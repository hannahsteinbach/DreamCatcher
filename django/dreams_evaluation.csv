"I see a house that is for rent. It looks familiar to me like I might have looked at it before. I walk up to the front and peek in an open door to a made over garage that might be a large bathroom. I realize I have looked at this house before and liked it. I walk in the front door to see a group of men, who are showing the house. A man in a dolly for a wheelchair is looking at the house also. There is no furniture. The living room is large. I like it. I walk through the living room to a wide spacious hall with large windows on the left ad several doors off to the right. I walk down the hall into a bedroom, which has a double bed in it and a rectangle wooden box like cradle with a baby in it. An old man is there making the bed. I am quite excited. This is the house. I must have. And even the baby is there as I anticipated. He looks old and tired. Howard enters the room. I tell him this is the house I want. He says great We'll take it. I ask the man how much the rent is. He says $1500 a month. I wince, that is too much! Howard in his eagerness to have us back together is on bended knee if front of me wearing  white pants and shirt. He says It's OK. I'll work it out somehow. I am unsure and concerned by I ignore those feelings because I want the house so much. I agree and we follow the man out to his office to close the deal. Howard goes first, the man and I follow as we walk up an outside stairway upstairs. The walking is difficult, because the steps are loose and wobble under my feet. I struggle to climb the stairs. The man says and there is $1300 a month for the conserve, which I understood to mean the insurance. Now it is clearly too much for us to pay. I hesitate."
"A young man and I are running upstairs to our new apartments which are side by side. I am now alone and I see the door to his apartment open. It's #624. I peek around the corner and happily call out to him because I know he's there and I really want to see the apartment. He says, ""Come in,"" and I walk around the corner. I see two rooms separated by a yellow lace curtain hanging on dark beautiful wood round hoops. I see pictures on the wall and furniture in place. The place has a warm lived-in feeling. Very pretty. I think, ""How did he do that so fast?"" My place is a mess with boxes stacked and nothing unpacked yet."
"I am walking in a street I Paris. It is about 6 o'clock. Nobody is out. Everything looks quaint and deserted. All the stores are closed and the blinds are down. I really feel all alone in the sleeping town, although it is too early for the people to be asleep. And then a car arrives and stops and my parents and my brother (he is 4 years older than me) are in it. They ask me why I am walking by myself and scold me a little bit. I go in the car with them and we ride through the deserted streets until we arrive home. But I don't recognize it at all. It seems to be somebody else's place. I am very much upset because the others seem to feel at home there, and not notice the difference. They act very natural, don't feel lost in this unknown house. I can just stand next to an unfamiliar table with a lamp on it and watch them, coming and going, and talking, feeling a stranger."
I notice I have put on the wrong pair of shoes.
"My supervisor tried the lights in the main room of the library -- for some reason they wouldn't go on for her. Me either. So we decided to tell Lauren we couldn't open the library because there would be no light. Lauren showed up and banged on the door -- I let her in, scowling, and told her what was happening, whereupon she tried the lights and found they worked for her. DAMN. So we had to run through the whole process of setting up, and I was angry with my supervisor for having raised my hopes in the first place. In the other room it was exactly the way everything had been in my room in Green City, except instead of my bookcase there was the pamphlet file, and of course I had no bed there. Hiding behind my chair and a large pile of books I poked idly through the 'A' file. In between American Artists and American Indians I was secretly composing a book, a few pages at a time. At one point Lauren burst in, but thankfully she didn't notice what I was doing. Somehow I began reading a pamphlet about Ed Ricketts, and I began to see the scene as it was narrated by a Steinbeck-like voice: ""Back in the thirties, we hired Ed to do some rock crushing for us."" (The view slowly zoomed in on Ricketts, who was standing behind a large pile of rocks in work overalls from the thirties, holding a shovel. He was beckoning me over. Narrator:) ""Come over here,"" he said to me one day. ""Look at this."" (I walked up and saw that he had dug up some strange sort of tree, one which had branches coming off it like a trimmed palm tree -- that is, the branches had been sawed off -- but these chevron-shaped branches had the color and consistency of celery. Narrator:) ""Ed! Thank God you cut this off at the root, because that's a part we can regrow. This is a water-bowl tree, Ed. It'll bring us a fortune!"" (Ed flushed and looked abashed. He helped me pick up the tree and load it into the nursery. While this scene was going on the voice-over said:) ""I think the waterbowl tree brought us $900 in 1948, the year of Rickett's death. With the money we established a memorial. I hope Ed, wherever he is, understands what we have done. These words were taken from John Steinbeck's ""My Life in California""."""
"Last night I had a dream about tornadoes. It was a very interesting dream, because I was able to hold the tornado in my hand. I remember this dream starting in a small town that had a lot of brown hills and had just two buildings. One of the buildings was a market and the other directly in front of it about thirty yards away was a large two story house. I was the only one in the store, and a radio was one. On the radio the man said there is a tornado on the way and everyone should grab shelter. Right then I thought about my aunt's house and how it would get blown away. Worried, I ran out of the market towards my aunt's house when I saw the tornado coming right for me. Not knowing what to do I ran straight for the tornado and picked it up. The soft swirling spinning swirling wind tickled my hand, so I started laughing a lot. Then I woke up from my weird dream."
"I was in a long, rather elaborate corridor which was brilliantly lighted by crystal chandeliers. There was a punch table around which many people were gathered, and groups were standing and walking around, giving an impression of constant activity. This was, I knew, a fraternity social affair. My date, however, seemed constantly to run off, returning later but giving me an uneasy feeling of being left alone. One of his quick trips back to me, he asked ""how's O.?"" and I felt surprised that he should know O.  I met a girl who was also alone, and the two of us went back to an elaborate lounge. After some muddled activity, I was back in the living room of my own home, and the mother of a friend (boy) of mine was asking me to give her a wide silver filigree bracelet that I own. Interpretation In retrospect this dream seems to be confusingly active; the activity, that is, of people constantly milling around. The corridor-like setting seemed very large, but because of the many people, was not vast.  My date, I presumed in the dream, was gotten for me by a friend of mine who is actually in the fraternity, and whose mother it was who later asked me for the bracelet. I do not know how I know it was his mother in the dream, for I have met her but once, and would not recognize her if I saw her again, I am sure. My surprise at being asked ""how O. was"" springs from the fact that I did not know that my date was not gotten for me by my fraternity friend, but my date was instead a friend of O. O., incidentally, is my ""unrequited."" Answers to questions 2. Passivity except for surprise where indicated in the dream report2. Participant4. Neither5. Given in dream (corridor; living room)6.

"Carrying Fishing Haven's Garbage  I'm in Carter Church basement with others. I go into the bathroom. My childhood friend Andy Jones is there with a woman who works here on some kind of project. They need to get into the bathroom, which is like a storage room as well. They interrupt me as I'm trying to defecate. I get up and leave, and they do what they need. I grab my stuff, and some garbage and walk out towards Carter School. A rock star that is a young kid with dyed red hair is playing in the church. People are setting up chairs as I leave. One man says that they need six more chairs, and indicates he wants me to help. I'm not going to help because I have nothing to do with what they're doing. I see a woman on my way to the recess door of the school. She asks me what I'm doing with Fishing Haven's garbage. I realize I'm carrying it, and I tell her that I'm in the habit of it, even though I recognize that I don't work at Fishing Haven anymore. I feel dumb saying this, and I want to get rid of the garbage, especially before my former bosses Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills see me! I walk over to the parking lot behind Carter School. I need somewhere to put the garbage. I go into a door below the steps and put the garbage into a can in the gymnasium. My truck is parked outside next to Fishing Haven's blue truck. My friend Beth Mock is driving the other truck. It's full of wood for building, which is from something that was dismantled. I think it looks like there are some maps of the Big Resort Area in back. When I look, there are not. I get into the truck with Beth. She tells me she's reading some letters to kill time before she goes to the dump. I think I should tell her she should go and just drive slowly, rather than sit here where she may be seen. Beth expresses her dislike for her job at Fishing Haven. We go to the dump. We go past a liquor store. My birthday comes up in conversation, since I'm now 21. We pass Francois' Restaurant, which is a huge liquor store. I say we should go there, and want to stop. We pass a police car. I tell Beth to keep her speed under 38 miles per hour because police will give tickets for anything more than that. She doesn't listen. I put my seat belt on in case we're pulled over. We drive to the dump, which is out on the Thru Highway, but we don't go that way. We are with other friends going to a concert. It's snowing. Something attached to her boot pulls Beth along the ground. I kneel in a red plastic sled and push myself along. We are then on 1st Street between Hill and Slope Avenues, in Oak Valley, on the south side of the road. We hear songs on the radio station 101.7 which Beth says are the same songs that are going to be played at a dance show that is happening tonight. I think this is the same thing we're going to. We move on the ground. There are tickets and wristband scraps all over the sidewalk and ground. Two older men leave the concert/festivity. They have wristbands on. I don't' have a ticket to this. Michael Jackson will be at the show dancing. I'd like to see him rather than just sitting and doing nothing. My cousin Archie Weber is by the Elgins house on the southeast corner of the intersection of 1st Street and Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. He tells me to pull off to the sidewalk. I do. There are broken sunglasses on the ground, but none that are good enough to wear. Archie is checking for a parking space near there which is why he wants me to wait."
Something about a boy in a wheelchair falling into a pond and a blow spout of water rescues him by blowing him up out of the water.
"I am at some religious healing revival meeting. Bonnie and Mateo are with me and some other woman. Behind me is an older woman and her husband. She is trying to talk to me and then starts repeating her words, like she's caught in a do-loop where she starts a sentence and can't finish it so she goes back and tries again. The husband cautions us not to interrupt her because that makes it worse. I have seated myself so I am near the aisle so I can wheelchair out if I need to. But as more people arrive, that aisle is filled up. I am given a huge syringe with a long needle. I watch another woman as she stabs herself with it and injects the healing fluid (which looks like water). I try it and make a stab at my leg. It goes through the muscle and out the other side (through the skin, really). The fluid leaks out I try and save it."
"We were looking down on some cartoons or comics of people doing different things. They were moving objects, like the last one was men singing. They came by with their mouth open, about three of them, and the last one had his mouth wide open about the size of a bowling ball. We were driving by the suburbs and at the end of the streets we saw big terraces or apartments. We saw some homes built up on stilts, four posts about 20 ft. off the ground and there were shady roofs with floors built away from the apartments for the tenants. They were built on big tree trunks about 5 ft. off the ground. I was flying around with some other fellows. Two of them were chasing one another. One had a gun and was trying to get a bead on the other one as they flew in a circle. Paul, the guard or watchman at Dill's, was selling something, as usual. We were working to 6 am that day."
Integration of Opposites  I see words that are written that have to do with the integration of opposites. I know something happens with the integration of opposites.
"I was riding a bicycle with a boy who is a student here at school and we were going to the movies. The surroundings were unfamiliar and we both suddenly realized there would be no place to put the bikes, so we returned. On the way back, however, he had to cross a bridge and when we got to the middle of it, it opened like a draw bridge, only too fast for us to get off. We both fell into the water, which seemed to be a canal. The water was very clear ad green like in a swimming pool and it took a lot of effort getting to the surface."
"Leaving Tour Group  I'm with a group. We are on a tour. I am not comfortable with the group. I leave the group, which may be all women, and go into a gym where people are playing basketball. I am with a male friend. We kind of want to play basketball. I have my leather hiking boots on."
"I had a dog, and it wasn't one of those dogs that was all over you, and I got it to somehow love me, and we were very close. Setting: Outside of my neighbor's house. Characters: The dog and me. The dog kind of looked like my grandpa's dog. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, loving, loyal. The dream made me feel like I could understand animals completely, and I really like that. I wish the dream could come true, because I really want a dog."
"A Ski Bog  I am snowboarding on a ski slope. My roommate Stephen Ramos is there. He is being a jerk. There is a competition between us. He goes down the hill, jumps, and cracks his snowboard. I am cautious about taking another lift farther up the hill. I see my classmate Amy Leopard on a ski lift. I go down the hill out of control, spinning and going backwards and forwards. At the bottom of the hill my classmate Alec Johnson is there. We joke around and wrestle. I wonder if I'll see him again. I have a flat football for a lift ticket. I see my high school classmate Lyle Zeffman and some other guys at a table when I rid the lift up. My high school classmates Kari Otis and Carol Derth are on a ski lift. I am about midway up the mountain. I go across the hill because I don't want to ski down, but I don't want to go up any higher either. I go by a sled race area. Two people in plastic sleds race down tracks, like ski racing. There is a big drift area, which is a bog, and is dangerous to go in. I new truck is parked near this bog. I don't go into the bog, but walk away from it. I man in line for the race or the lift makes fun of me. I say to him, ""Hey mate, shut the fuck up!"" I go up on a lift. I try to get on a chair with some women but they go ahead of me and I am not quick enough. I ride up the lift alone. My old classmate Gino Teavor is then on my chair. Our classmate Bud Slick and two women are a few feet in front of us in a chair. We talk about fishing. Gino has several small spinners in his hat or somewhere. As we ride up the lift there is very little snow, and grass is everywhere. Gino points out a broken light bulb. I don't want to go up farther to the more difficult hills, but I do."
"I wanted some ice cream. I bought some hot buttered rum, really syrupy and sugary. I took it home to the old house in M City. My mother saw it and said, ""Oh, now, I'll pay for that."" I said, ""No, it's O.K. You don't have to pay me back. Just have some."" But even as I said it, I knew she would pay me back and I would accept gladly. Later, I told my brother Dwight that my van wasn't running quite right. There was a loping in the motor sound. I said, ""I guess I'll take it to be fixed. How much will it cost?"" He said, ""I'll do it for you and won't charge much."" My mother wore blue jeans."
"A croquet game is being played--at Grandpa's house, it seems, although the court is much, much bigger than his.  It is so wide and thick with grass that with all my power I cannot strike a ball across it.  There are also numerous obstacles such as shooting around a corner when you come out of the first two wickets.  Once, when my turn comes, I see my ball lying within about one foot of another ball, but as I draw closer, I see that it is quite a bit farther.  I hit it, however, and upon taking mallet's length to take two shots, I must lie through a doorway or a wicket or the like.  This means I will have to swing almost parallel with this object in order to strike my ball cleanly and at the same time miss the corner of the object.  I shoot at another ball, about 25 yards away.  With the first shot, I miss the ball at which I am aiming by several inches."
Packing in a hurry. Suitcase pretty full. Putting in knickers and underwear. Too full. Decide to take out knickers and three other garments and roll them up. Also look for brush and comb case. Ask sister (?) to call drayman for trunk. Some trouble in getting it done.
Talking to Miss. W. She complains she can't hear. I tell her she should wear her hearing aid all the time. I get tired standing over her all the time which seems to be the only time she hears me.
I was with Karyn L. She had three children. I was surprised to learn that she had been married and had three children as she is gay. I thought about how Mary Kay C must feel about becoming an instant parent. But she is so kind and loving I knew it would not be a problem for her. I knew she would soon be coming to live with Karyn L.
"r had taken my Godmother's daughter, who is 17 and like a sister to me, to some sort of a lesson & while waiting for her I thought I would talk with one of the advisors at this building. I believed it to be like a placement service. I went into a room and found a man well dressed who spoke like a physician instead of a placement advisor. He began questioning me about my feelings, I became afraid for he said I would need a series of treatment which would be expensive. I told him the reason I came was that I wanted to find some sort of part time work. He didn't seem to understand, & he told me to take G. home but to come back because I was a sick person. I hurried out, but didn't have any thought of returning. It was raining when we went out side - as we walked along I noticed that this mob was following us. I saw a street car coming so I told G. to on to my house, that I was going to take the street car & go to her house. I felt that I must talk to her mother about what had happened. However when I was on the car I found that this person was there also. I had forgotten to get a transfer so I went back and obtained one. When it was time to change cars I got up quickly & ran for the next car. It seemed as if I got on the car with out being followed this time. Interpretation Perhaps it was related some what to all the reading I have been doing about psychology and mental illness. Answers to questions 2. I was afraid and anxious3. actual participant4. unpleasant5. Room, street, street car6. No7. Dark suit of the man"
"I was the owner of a large styling salon. A salesman came in to demonstrate and try to sell me a vacuum. It was a very powerful machine. I tried it out by vacuuming the entire salon. I used the attachments and vacuumed hair from around the baseboards. I accidentally moved the attachment right by a client's face and the stylist insinuated that the vacuum removed her facial hair from that side of her face by complimenting the client on how beautiful her skin was. I looked and noticed that she had facial hair on the other side of her face. I didn't do or say anything else about it. I finally told the salesman that I was going to be working on budgetary items during the coming week so I would be able to give him my decision then. I wanted the vacuum but I also think I was trying to give him an excuse rather than saying no to him at that point. My husband owned an auto and appliance repair business right next door to my salon. I went and talked to him about my intentions with budget and that I was considering some business changes that would improve both sales and profits and allow the stylists to make more money as well. I found out that my stylists rarely get any tips. I suggested that we should put a little sticker on the corner of each of their mirrors that says Tips are appreciated as this is an important part of our stylists income. When I first started talking to my stylists about some of the changes I was going to make all but 2 or 3 of them got up and quit. Eventually they all came back. I think as they spoke with the ones who stayed about the changes they became convinced that it would be a very good thing. My husband wasn't very supportive but he didn't stand in my way either. He didn't want me to do anything with his business though. I did suggest that they put up a basketball goal on the corner of his lot so the employees could relax a little on their breaks by shooting hoops. I also thought this was something that the employees wanted. I don't know if it actually happened or not. there was some kind of an evil person trying to sabotage my business. I don't remember much about this part. I did find out later that he was connected to my husband. as though my husband was behind it. I managed to get rid of this person though and the changes were being very successful. The stylists were dressing much nicer when they came to work. They were much happier, getting nice tips, and the clients were very happy with the changes. There was one stylist that was the hardest to win over. She had studied clinical counseling but then decided to become a stylist instead. She took care of her clients in a private room so they could speak privately with her while she took care of them. She wasn't acting in an official counseling capacity but used her knowledge to help them while she was taking care of their styling needs. She combined them in a manner as to not put herself or us in any kind of legal jeopardy. She was very happy when I encouraged this and gave her a private room so she could do so more effectively. Her clients were especially pleased with her. They had something to do with an airline or flights. There was a person that looked like or was dressed like an angel or a fairy, with sparkling wings that fell gently from the sky. She landed, or her wings became caught, on something like bleachers. This is where I found her and freed her. She was somehow connected to my husband and this evil person that I had to deal with earlier. Maybe she was a distraction."
"I'm in the diner across from the library eating a ""Veggie-Burger"" with some other people. They all get finished and go, but there's one woman still here, and she says, ""How can you eat that? Whenever I eat any kind of meat I just get sick"", and I'm really startled. I thought this was a veggie/soy patty of some sort, and I scrape the melted cheese off (rather a lot, a white cheese with bits of peppers and other veg in it) and examine the patty closely - by George it looks like hamburger - thin, but hamburger - and I pull it apart with my fingers to see if it feels like meat. It does. I take it up to the counter. The woman there isn't the regular person but I show her and complain, ""How can you do this? This is hamburger! What a rotten thing to do!"" She's somewhat taken aback but doesn't say anything. In the back of my mind I've been thinking they must have thought they could call it ""Veggie-Burger"" if they just put vegetable things on top."
"The next night I had a little nicer dream. I dreamt that I was babysitting a kid named Joey, and I think it came from a Joey that my mother used to babysit. But this Joey was a toddler, and he had like two other kids running around and they were girls. And they had a keyboard in their room. It was a few more octaves than the Music Major, but it was kind of similar. And it came with these little figures of girls with instruments that you had to stand on the, you know, the top ledge above where the keys are. And they were just little things that came with it, and they each had a story. You know, the plastic like the Easter rabbit that comes on top of those candy things? Well, it was kind of like that. There was a tall, slender -- and these were about 4 or 5"" high -- there was a tall, slender Caucasian woman in a pink dress, like a prom dress, with a flute. And then there was a short, kind of fat black girl with a trumpet. And there was sort of a brownish gray in-between person with some kind of harp thing. And there was somebody else with a French horn that was like a little boy. And they had a storybook that went along, and as you read the story, you were supposed to play the part of each character and you were supposed to change the keyboard to their particular instrument sound. And the kids and I were trying to do this. It was kind of funny, but the kids and I were trying to do this, and I don't remember if we ever got through it, but it was something along, ""Here comes Letty; she's ready to see her."" And then ""doot, do, doot, do, do"" and ""Now, here comes the other one. She's a little more shy, doot, do, doot, do, do,"" or something like that. And I don't remember anything more."
"I'm sitting in a cafe with a couple of other - I think women - yeah - and we're next to the window, on the street - we're in a booth. And there's a factory, or some sort of plant, across the street (it's not a very wide street). There's an alarm going off in the place across the street, and somehow I know that the thing is gonna blow up - or something's gonna blow up over there, and it's all very ominous. Nothing is actually happening right away, but [...?...] then suddenly there's a light in one of the sections closest to the street, really not precisely where I thought things were gonna be happening from, and - it's funny, it's as if I can see this happening even though I'm getting under the table - we decided it would be the better part of valor to duck. The light starts out small, and then grows to a flash, and then something goes boom, and then we say ""Uh-oh"", and crouch down under the table. And we cover our heads with our arms, like we did when we were in school, anyhow, and I'm not entirely sure this is gonna do the trick 'cause it's liable to be a pretty big explosion."
"Me and Molly were playing in the street in [a vacation state] and her mom was there and we were asking strangers some questions and then a stranger asked us to get in a car. We got in the car, and then he drove us somewhere. I was in a car--mommy's--and he drove us to a house that looked like ours, but with different things. We wanted to get home so we called 911. I was only 4 in the dream."
"My wife Bonita and I, maybe Norman, their parents, my sister Nancy, and Nancy's boyfriend were all sleeping in sleeping bags on the floor in some house.  Most of us had had a couple of drinks, except the elder Lingermans, who were asleep.  Harold got up, though, and Nancy's boyfriend had just set half a drink down on the kitchen cabinet.  It was about 3 a.m.  I was afraid we would all get in trouble."
"I am looking through an old box of things and come across a newspaper clipping. I also see a paper I wrote on. The beginning word of each sentence created its own sentence, when you put them together. I chuckle to see my old childish way of coding words. I read the words. It says, ""I am a playwright."" I look at the newspaper clipping: a head and shoulders shot of me, like when I was the manager of the Fair Store in M City. The paragraph under it said I had received some awards for my writing. Some man, who is annoyed and jealous, says that I always get mentioned before and after banquet events. How come? I feel a little embarrassed."
"I heard in my sleep, ""2-2, 2pp. 1st.r and 2-2nd race."" I was driving my car. A kid pushed a pile of cans in front of me and when my car hit the cans, it stopped dead and I hit the steering wheel with my stomach and I sort of knocked myself out for a while. I noticed I had the traffic blocked as I went around the car. A cow or bull was biting my hand, then it hit for my face and it held my breath as it got close to my face and I awoke."
"I'm driving a friend down Centennial Loop. I'm describing the way so she'll know how to get around on her own. We pay over several bridges. They are monuments to Elvis Presley of Memphis. I see a blue and white 55 Chevy convertible in perfect shape. Then we're walking across the bridge. There are thousands of scrapbooks with interesting stories in them, stories of women who had stirring psychic events. I then stop reading them. I say, ""I don't believe it. If it had happened to so many, then I would have felt it too."" I then see my mother. She is flying. She does a dance on the top of a street light. I then decide to fly too. I do so. I go up to her. We're up at the height of the telephone wires. I say to her, ""Let's go higher."" She says, ""Ha! This is hard work, just to get this high."" I worry about suddenly losing the power to fly if I go higher, then it will really hurt if I fall. I see a line of people like in a carnival stage. We go closer to see. The women are mostly naked. One person is invisible. We go closer and discover that it is a man, fully dressed in a brown suit and tie. The reason no one can see him is because of a light that goes on and off behind him. He comes over to us and says, ""Fix the food."" We ask, ""What kind of food?"" He says, ""You know the usual, African food."" My mother and I grow pretty white wings and fly across the street. With the wings, I feel secure now and not afraid of falling. I am delighted at their beauty and how cleverly they tuck in when they're not in use, so no one sees them. I fly up to a guy and ask him where the food is so we can prepare a meal. His eyes widen as he sees my wings. I'm fluttering them effortlessly to maintain my stillness in mid-air. My mother and I start to set the table, in mid-air."
I was driving around. I was loading coal into my truck.
"I am back home in M. City: Amy & Reynaldo have come by, and also Hillary. But nothing is ready yet for the party. I wait for others to arrive. While I wait, we walk around with Father Andrew and look at photos and pictures various people have taken. He is very appreciative and talks with everyone. I get his attention and show him a painting by Wendy of the Annunciation! We are all impressed and he thanks me profusely. We go back to my birthday party."
"Autofellatio 1  I'm in my old bedroom, which is now my sister Ramona's bedroom, upstairs, at home. There are a few people downstairs. I open the door to the little attic in her room, and turn the light on. I sit down and start giving myself fellatio. I scrunch up in a ball and my penis reaches my mouth. It doesn't feel nearly as good as when someone else has done this for me. I can't ejaculate; I can barely even maintain an erection."
"I had this weird dream. I was at a Waldbaum's Food Mart, at the cashiers place and somehow I told her that I had to take this liquid medicine that the gynecologist had prescribed, I asked her if she could tell me how much to take. She said ""This isn't liquid medicine, this is nitroglycerin for your heart."" I said ""I don't have any trouble with my heart."" But I took them from the cashier and somehow I wound up at a place with round picnic tables and there were a bunch of people there, males and females that I didn't know. I asked someone about this stuff, this liquid like a Maalox or something that I should be taking for my stomach. They said ""Oh, those are heart pills, do you have trouble with your heart?"" and I said, ""No."" and I ended up putting the bottle of pills in the shower. It was still sealed. How the shower got into it I do not know."
"(02/21/97)[""In bed with Howard, again.""] I am in bed with Howard. He lies on my left side and he wants to make love. I feel uncomfortable but I don't move away. I am naked and lying on my back. He is cautious and asks me frequently if this is all right. I feel the old feelings of frustration, because it is like it was when we were married. He is trying to manipulate me into feeling sexy so I will consent to making love. I feel sad."
"I was looking in the paper and I saw in the selections The Dragon in large print. I saw others, but can't recall them now. My dad (deceased) now was staying with us for a while. I thought of him and also thought he could stay on and not go live by himself. He would have to pay his board and his heating bill."
"Go back to nursery school: Mrs. Pearlman is back; I am tired, lie down on the bed. Hear other teachers talk about me, then see group of people gather for a meeting; see Father Andrew in shining, shortsleeved robe standing under a bridge taking photos of dignitaries; I run up to him as he walks by and impulsively say ""I knew it was Father,"" then he hesitates, smiles and gives me a bottle. I am very ashamed and realize I am still a baby.
- Then I hear him talk to others and also hear how they criticize my running the nursery school; ""Can't I do anything right?"" ""Well, this was O.K. in fact it was excellent."""
"I asked the blond young man sitting in the second of the row of chairs, ""Have you finished dinner and are you now in line?"" He said, ""Yes."" ""Now I must go and help my circle leader at the ditch digging near our house."" ""Where is that?"" I had trouble remembering but at last said, ""The foreign language building."" ""Oh yes, I know where that is."" ""Now I must be off to the ditch digging,"" and I set off."
"I was a ballerina turning around in a glass ball. I was dressed in white and blue snow was falling all around me. At first I was happy just spinning around, but after a while I became panicked. I suddenly had to get out. The ball would not break no matter how hard I tried, but the floor did and I went tumbling into white powder. Setting: In a glass ball. Characters: No one but me. Feelings and Thoughts: Angry, scared, worried, panicked. I believe sometimes I feel trapped in the mold I have at school which could be represented by this."
"I was at Grandma's house. Denny Carter and his wife were there. They had two daughters. One was walking and the other one was still small and in a buggy. The walking one went to the buggy and I was afraid it would harm the small one by scratching the eyes for face, but she just looked at it and went on walking. There was a big fly in the house. I got the fly swatter and hit the big fly and knocked it down on the floor. There were a lot of small flies on the floor, so I was swatting them all. We had two trees in the kitchen. My brother Steve said, ""Looks like one of them moved a little to the falling stage."" I looked and sure enough, down it came. Then sometime later the other tree came down also. It hit the window, broke the panes, then when the top of the tree went thru the window as the top hit the ground, it flopped over and landed on the neighbor's driveway. To my surprise, the trees were about 40 ft. high and still they were supposed to be growing in my mother's kitchen and the ceiling is only 9 ft. high. I went outside and looked at the tree. It lay on the neighbor's driveway. I thought of calling the press and have a photographer come and take a picture of it. It was an unusual freak of work. I was looking at a neighbor's name plate on his house and it was Buick."
"White Wolf  It is the night before a trip. I'm at home sleeping. There are two small kids there. My sister Ramona is sleeping in her room. My cousin Melvin Redding comes into my room. It is very early in the morning. He is about two years old. I am awake. One of the kids has wet their bed. I am downstairs. It feels like I am taking care of something, maybe the wet bed. My brother Wally asks me if Ramona is okay. He says she has seen a white wolf. I run upstairs to check on her. When I turn to go up the stairs I look out a window. In the back yard where we set the garbage is a snow fort, like an igloo. A light is being shined upon this structure. I run upstairs, into Ramona's room. My old roommate Jens Nils is sleeping in Ramona's bed. He was what she was scared of. His girlfriend Natasha Lens is sleeping in the bed too. I leave. They laugh at me for thinking it was a wolf that scared Ramona. I take a plastic bag, but bring it back because it has Jens' stuff in it. I have no respect for Jens. The family is now up. They are packing for this trip at 5:30 or 6:00 am. I think it is too early: we should go back to bed. There are apple muffins made that aren't good."
I was in a house. A washing machine in the next room was vibrating so violently that it was shaking the whole house.
"Frank and Zena are taking a train to Phoenix to meet a woman named Dorothy. I am angry at Frank and try to dissuade him. Then I say: ""Go ahead, go already"" and leave. sad and angry."
I was making something. Later I was wandering through a small town.
"(12/17/99)[""Upset ambulance driver.""] I am talking to a young man. We are looking at a large expanse of lawn and a curvy dangerous road. I am telling him that the new road will cut across this lawn and be safer and easier to get to the college. Now we both get in my manual chair to go back toward town. We slide off the sidewalk onto a lawn bank. I am wearing white high heels which makes pushing the wheelchair with my feet very hard and painful. We struggle to get the wheelchair back on the sidewalk. He gets out to make it easier. I am now going downhill and call out this is the fun part. I go faster and faster. Then I hit gravel and come to a stop. I get out and we walk toward the town. Now we are in the back of an ambulance racing toward town. We are observing. A woman is supposedly dead and bloody under a sheet. She met with some terrible fatal accident. But I hear breathing. I'm not sure if she is dead or not. We arrive downtown. We get out. I hear a woman say if you want help fixing up the fire house, you have to buy my two mink stoles that are in litigation with my case I'm doing. We agree to do that. I place the two mink stoles on a shelf in the entrance to the fire house. The entrance is blocked by these shelves. A woman who likes the ambulance driver puts a series of yummy breakfast dishes on the other shelves. The driver comes there and sees this. He is angry and upset. His mother had two mink stoles she would have liked to get rid of and now she can't. And someone broke the tradition of the breakfast dishes. He is angry at the woman who likes him. She is trying to convince him to relax and enjoy the breakfast dishes. Sweet rolls and so on. He is in a huff."
"I am traveling. I go to Germany. Cousin Abner is there. They are friendly. I sit in an old overstuffed chair that sort of dumps you to the floor. It's a room for old ladies. Then Dovre and I catch a bus. I can't find the ticket booth, so the driver shows me. I walk up a steep hill. The bus then takes us to Paris, France. We then walk up another steep hill to see the beautiful idyllic country scenery. We walk through a cafe and I remember I don't know how to speak French. A woman suggests I speak German. I remember I can speak Spanish. I say, ""Comer!"" Later on the hill at sun rise I am delighted with the view and at my camera ready. As I prepare to take a picture, I notice lots of people, tourists, in the way. I have waited too long."
"My birthday. I had a kind of a strange dream last night. I dreamt that I was in the summer transition program for Watson (?) Center and it was more like being at Full Sail. Me and three other students were in this room and there was this big, huge synthesizer mixer board. It looks like a huge version of my Tascan board, but it was this guy that was the instructor and he was showing us about how, he was showing us with an organ sound and he wanted to change it, but he couldn't get any others. And so when this other guy came in with another student, he asked the student to show him. And you had to mix automation and change it. Then I dreamt that we were in the car with Edith and Stella and Bonnie and they were all kind of, you know how they're all kind of complainers. Well, for some reason Josie gave me a thing of milk and said, ""Here, take this so we won't have to wrap it."" And they took us home and then we were home and then I woke up."
"Fourteen Out of A Hundred  I get my psychology cognition report back. I watch the woman as she scores it, and she makes comments about my use of the word ""intent"" and ""intent to intent"". She criticizes my writing, saying I say nothing substantial. She hands me back my paper with a score of 14 out of 100 points! I'm extremely surprised, because I thought it was at least a fair piece of writing. I tell her I thought it was pretty good. She tells me to redo it. I tell her I want to get an appointment with her to talk with her about it. Everyone seems to get a low score. A bright Asian man gets only 35 out of 100. My acquaintance Rachel Steiner rides by on a bicycle."
"There was a school rampage.  I was in the back of the car with someone, maybe my brother Stuart, when it started. Four people wanted to destroy everything.  They had machine guns.  During the shooting, bombs started to rain down from the sky.  The car provided ridiculously good shelter. We stayed crouched out of window view, and felt cold debris raining down stinging our backs.  Having our backs as the nearest body parts exposed may not have been the best idea, but we didn't have a lot of time to think.  Several times I felt the urge to raise my head and look.  We didn't know how close they were, and I thought we might be better off running if the opportunity arose.  But I knew better.  Spatters of blood came through the window.  At some point the firing finally ceased, and we managed to get out of the car- somehow, we got hold of three of the shooters.  There was a little boy named Blake on the other side of a cyclone fence.  I ran to him and told him to run and call the police; then I noticed I was standing right next to a payphone.  Blake came through.  The police came.  There was still one shooter loose, though.  I was very relieved when I saw my father amongst the scatter of people, and I ran to him.  He wore janitor's overalls and had a broom.  Upon reaching him, I faltered.  Was it really him?  It looked like him, but I wondered.  I gave up.  I was too relieved to care if it wasn't.  I hugged him.  My carelessness was unwise.  It was the fourth shooter.  I woke up."
"I was working on edits of BCB. I was also doing something with other titles, and talking with Bill C."
"A married woman who looks a little like me and whose hair feels like my mother's has suggested we make love. I feel uncomfortable, but also sexually excited, and I get into bed with her. I turn over on my side, with my back to her, thinking it would be better if we sleep first and then make love after we've rested. Actually, what I'm doing is avoiding it. So she approaches me and I shrug my shoulders and turn to face her. I can barely look her in the eye. I feel slightly disgusted and apprehensive. As she starts to take off my several layers of night gowns, I feel very excited, and then a younger woman comes into the bedroom through a skinny door by the bed. She glances at me and then says, ""They're here."" She goes to another door and opens it up. Several young, good-looking men come in and more women come in. These men are prostitutes. Her husband let them in. The woman goes to them and in a very business like manner. These people couple up, the man behind like he's riding a horse. They're all grunting and pumping. It's a pure sex act. I'm embarrassed. One guy comes to me and acts like he'll do me next. I say, ""No."" The woman whose bed I'm in is annoyed and disgusted with me. What a weenie! So she goes to the men and they're all going at it. I'm still sexually excited. I lay in the bed waiting for it to be all over and she returns so we can continue. Someone brings me the Visa bill to sign for my part of the festivities. I almost sign and then decide that since I didn't partake, I didn't have to pay. The woman heard this and glared at me. She's really disgusted with my wimpy behavior. I want to leave, but feel some obligation to wait and continue with plans as they originally were."
This reminds me of the TV show Overhaulin.
"I am told I must drink deep of the river. I submerse myself and breathe in the water deeply. Small, white baby seals swim by. I stand up and a man comes by, taunting me, smiling. ""You did the wrong thing,"" he said. ""If you drink that water, you'll get dizzy and ill."" I don't know who to believe, but I feel deep down to drink is the right choice. I look up river and see a life-size crucifix of Christ floating toward me."
"I was in a place I was unfamiliar with but I was in the living room, I knew that. I was sitting on the floor in the middle of the room. There was no furnishings in it at all, I have no idea why I was there. I was aware that behind me, sort of at the far wall there were 2 boys. They seemed oriental I could hear their murmured voices, but I couldn't understand what they were saying because I do believe they were talking in their native tongue. I knew though, that these 2 boys had been brought there to be tortured before being killed. Now in the kitchen which was in front of me, there was another boy, and all of them seemed to be around the same age and I would guess, from the voices, 10 or 11 years old. The one in the kitchen didn't seem to be in any particular danger, he was just out there playing with a small sized ball I would say, a Ping-Pong ball or a superball or maybe he was just simply bouncing it around. I don't know what happened. I don't want to know."
"I went ??? the. I needed to get some money so I went to the Oaks Cinema. They were all out. Then I went to the ???, which was closed on Monday. Elena turned into Evelyn and we lived in the tree house above the ground floor movie (theater). She had $9.00. A guy captured me when he was walking around and around and around the town square. When he marched me around the town square holding a gun in my back, I was so scared I couldn't talk. I opened my mouth to say something, to yell,, and nothing would come out. He had a razor blade with the single edge blade and Dora grabbed it from him to try and save me and I screamed, ""Dora, DON'T!"" But she had already grabbed it with her hand, her palm was already way ??? She closed her hand to save mine and it got cut deep and bloody, bad from the razor blade."
"In this dream I dreamt we were walking in the suburbs of a large city which I recognzied to be Rocky River. The group consisted of four other youths about my own age. We were walking along the sidewalks laughing and talking although I can't recall any words I was saying. There is a bridge in Rocky River by the Westlake Hotel which I pass on my way home. In the dream we walked onto the approach to the bridge and prepared to cross over it. As we walked onto it, the others dropped back a little and I was all alone. Suddenly it began to hail and the others ran into a gas station to escape the very large stones that fell. I was caught on the bridge and was undecided which way to go as I was afraid I would be hurt by the stones. the others yelled at me that I would get hurt so I rushed back across the bridge and ducked into a small shed in which was the colored gas station attendant."
"I was unraveling some string I was going to tie on a post. Some men gathered around me and were going to beat me up. They accused me of going around nude. I yelled for, ÒHelp Police,Ó but no one came. I seemed to get away from them and was running and kind of going up flying like. Mr. Fisher (deceased) was coming behind me, then he turned into a young man and he was catching me by the foot. Bob and I were hunting. He shot twice and got two pheasants. I walked over and picked one of them up. As I was walking, I saw a rabbit standing. I thought he was dead and stiff. I was going to poke him with my gun. When I got close he ran. By the time I got my gun up, he was in the bushes and I found out my gun was broke. I had no shells in it."
"I was in a canoe with several people. We were shooting arrows at a women's clothing store which was on a kind of an island. We had a store on the mainland, and they were our competition and had forced us to close. When we had each shot three arrows, we were all out of arrows and had to stop shooting. I got out of our canoe and went into the store. It had heavy glass doors. I told the woman who owned it that we had lost the fight, and I wanted to pick up our arrows. I began to pick them up, and as I did so I picked up some of her arrows. Most of the arrows were hers, but they were not marked. The arrows were all different colors, and all the green ones belonged to her. Mine were red and purple, but I could not find many of mine. Instead, I took some of the arrows that could not be identified."
"I am shown a sweet little kitty white with black spots, like a Dalmatian. He is called a Grandma Cat. I hold him and pet him. Then a man throws the kitties out of the compound into the dangerous outlying area. I am furious with him and stand up tall and look up at him and tell him off. How can a person who treats innocent kitties this way can be trusted as a leader of the people? I go out to the dangerous area and dig in the dirt and find a kitty like Boomer. I am so happy to find him. I must bring them back into the safety of the compound."
"The atom bomb was to go off so we hurried outdoors and down to the beach to see the glow. I wondered if I should have left my handbag. With everyone gone it was a good time for thieves. Before us were quite a number of people lined up in groups along the shore. ""Look there,"" I cried. Streams of bright light coming from beneath a dark cloud but no auroral display. I wondered why they shot the day after yesterday's failure. (We are the household from the Home where I live.)"
"On going to bet, Sun Umber came to me as a voice."
There were a few marrow bones in a dish. There were large piles of cinders or rubbish piled up on a hill like. I found a small stick in the pile of cinders. There was snow on the ground.
"I'm in a play. I'm playing a male part. I have fake whiskers glued on. I am playing ""The King of Israel."" I walk to the stage area and stand on an empty stage. I know the throne is there, but I just can't see it. I'm waiting for the audience to be seated. A chorus is singing on bleachers between me and the audience. Open bleachers are near me at the front of the stage. Some people sit there in case I fall. I pace and then decide to start. I announce, ""I am the King of Israel"" and I place myself on the throne. Someone playing God's angel comes in and says, ""God didn't say you could do that,"" and I said, ""But I know He will"" The play goes on. I worry if my false whiskers are going to fall off."
"I go into a bathroom, and when I open the door, I see a dirty old man sexually hitting on two kids. I slam the door shut fearfully and run to a close phone to call for the police. Then I realize I'd left the kids in there with him. Before I have to go back in there to get them, he lets them out and then he comes out to get me. I retreat back into the room. He is a horrible, mean man. Now there's a little mouse he torments. I wait for the police to come and save me. Somehow he goes away. I go back in the bathroom and look around at his lair. I see shelves and a secret trap door into the attic. I pull a chain of beads that somehow represent my Aunt's eyes. She's dead many years. I shudder and go up the shelves to have a look. Perhaps there is treasure up there. Maybe he's up there, or a trap. I am scared and then throw myself up quickly and peek around and zip back down quickly. I do this over and over, each time using my arm and hand to sweep out of the attic anything I touch, hoping like crazy I don't touch anything awful. There are dust, dirt, layers of rotted away stuff, but nothing else. Then I see a lighted glass case that has my ""Aunt's"" favorite things. They are glass articles: statues of head and shoulder, pictures of her in her favorite pose, hats with feathers, coiffured wigs, pretty things. I guess she liked to see likenesses of herself."
"I dreamed about using the computer, reading some files, listening to them. Nothing unusual. Dreaming about the files that I would read or wanted to read, typing on the keyboard."
"I have a personal assistant named Mary who is mentally retarded, short and chubby. She keeps talking all the time and doing things wrong, like holding the shampoo bottle upside down and not noticing the shampoo is running out all over her clothes. I ask her to help me take a bath. I am in the tub in my clothes, she has gotten my wallet wet and is trying to fix it and she is nonstop talking. I finally say to her, ""Damn it, Mary, you're fired. I know you mean well and you're a hard worker, but you keep making mistakes."" She gets in the tub with me and is trying hard to convince me not to fire her. I insist she get out. Finally I call Nancy in, who is visiting. She and Charlene are out in the living room talking. I explain to Nancy why I'm firing Mary and ask her to get her out of my tub. Nancy says, ""OK,"" gets her out and then says, ""I'm not the one to be telling this to."" I agree, saying, ""Sorry, I guess I was just ventilating."" I wonder if this was such great timing, firing her when I was in the tub, a vulnerable spot for me. I also feel a bit concerned because now I have to find someone else. Maybe Charlene will work for me again. I think, ""After all, she's been volunteering here for a while, so maybe she's got time again and wouldn't mind making $6 an hour."" She is telling Nancy she just got one of her plays produced."
"(02/11/97)[""Returning to work at Community College.""] I returned to work at Community College. They have moved the Disabled Student's department upstairs on the fourth floor. I walk up the stairs, wondering if I should use the elevator. But I feel strong enough to make it. I see women working there that remember me and we talk. I am led to a room off in a corner which was used for storage. It is long and narrow but has a window and a nice oak desk with pigeon holes drawers in them. I say this will be nice when we get it fixed up. The students can use that end by the door for their support groups and connecting and I can use this desk for the paper work. I come back out and start to walk down the stairs but the stairs are steep and the steps are tilted so it is dangerous to walk on it. I am wearing high heels too. So I decide to find the elevator. I find it but can't figure out what to push. There are two metal plates with words on them. One is loose and keeps moving. I walk down the stairs after all, this time with no problem. I ask someone where my wheelchair is. I had left it on the second floor. I go where it should be and a play is going on. I sit at a small round table, Angel my assistant is there. Now I see that they are filming a soap opera there and Dylan has an acting part. And Tyler and other counselors are a part of the crowd scene. Apparently they do this every day."
"I don't remember the start of the dream, it might have been related to the X-men.  Someone (me?) with two baby sheep were high above a body of water on a beam protruding from the side of a Truss bridge, and approached Elaine from Seinfeld, who was asleep.  I handed her the sheep and put them against her to suckle- I was here for her help (I think I was a man and unable to suckle the sheep myself).  Elaine said they weren't suckling, and I told her that was exactly what the problem was.  Then, from a sort of sky-view, I noticed someone walking across the bridge with a leash on something in front of him.  I zoomed in to see it was Wallace (from Wallace and Gromit).  The leash was on Shaun, and there was a whole herd of sheep in front of him.  I was hopeful and went down to talk to him.  Somehow the dream related back to the X-men dream and the young sheep showed their heritage.  Black sheep, with a Zoidberg (from Futurama) face.  (I guess Zoidberg was the bad guy)."
I dreamed I was getting information about the killer grandfather.
"I was at a beach party with many people I knew, yet I felt lonely because the fellow I had come with had gone back to the car for something forgotten. It was a very black night with a haze over the water about 1/4 of a mile out. I wanted to swim into the haze and I knew I was a good enough swimmer to do it, but I was afraid of what was beyond the haze. I swam out to it and forced myself to go into it. It covered me like a blanket and I quickly returned to shore really afraid. Interpretation I like to swim and in the water I like to go far and it pleases me to make other people get mad or anxious by doing this. I know I'm a good enough swimmer not to drown and it's one silly way of getting attention; but more than that, I personally feel I've accomplished something by swimming a great distance than I have a slight fear of drowning. Answers to questions 2. Fear3. Participant4. Unpleasant5. A beach6. No!7. No!"
"I'm at grandma Mildred's house, packing to go somewhere, maybe school. Bonnie is around. Then my ""son"" wants to build a harp. I tell him, ""That's too hard,"" but he insists and does build an ornate, complex instrument that sort of folds up. I then find a picture, a photo, where you can see the jigsaw patterns. One part still has the puzzle pieces on it. We remove the parts. Something is wrong with the lady's eye. I called it a name and ask what was wrong. No one knew. The boy is impressed. He says he's amazed at how talented I am. I am equally amazed because he's more talented than me! Doctor A, doctor drama, acting."
"I had been napping and I knew I needed to do something but couldn't wake up or get my eyes open. Just walked through the house and did whatever it was I needed to do anyway. Matthew was much younger. Conversations with neighbors. Looking outside and realizing that I am still getting used to where I am now living. I forgot that it is a very short walk, across something that resembles a large, gravel parking lot, to a number of small stores. I asked him if he wanted to walk across this large gravel area to a convenience store and get a popsicle. I took some change from my wallet and placed it in my pocket. Popsicle in my pocket. The first one partially melted but I ate it anyway. A second and third one completed melted. None of the three had been in wrappers. Tennis courts surrounded by chain link fence. People playing on one of them. Different people playing on them now. I decided to walk down one small street that was lined with small shops, and then go home and make a list of the shops that were there that we might want to visit the future. The list was to remind us that they were there so we wouldn't get in the car and drive to other stores for the same thing. Driving down a narrow country road that was hardly big enough for two cars. It had been raining. Lots of water puddles. Some I tried to avoid. Mostly I tried to drive very slowly so the water wouldn't splash up on the car. I mostly didn't want it to splash on the windshield. I realized I slowly I was driving and wondered if there were any cars behind getting aggravated with me. When I turned around to look there were no other cars there. At that point, it also felt more as if I was walking."
"R. asked me for directions for my typewriter as hers was giving her trouble. I said, ""yes, I had them."" and looked in my desk cubbyhole for them, no luck, pulled out all the papers, not among them. Then I remembered I had removed them from desk and put them in the typewriter case. I was visiting some of my family and had planned to go to the Strongs who were on the other side of city on Wednesday. But M. told me they were expecting their children on Thursday who'd leave Friday so I decided to wait until Saturday."
"I had bought Grandma F's house to save it from being torn down. Part of me is very excited to be there and part of me is very worried about moving back to the country, especially to St. Joe. I think Matthew and I talk about it a little. He has the same mixed feelings. There is so much baggage attached to living there. The house was refurbished/remodeled before we closed on the sale. I was in the kitchen talking to someone from my family about what a great job Marlene F's family had done refurbishing this house. The house was much, much larger in the dream than in waking life. I see something in the bottom drawer of the stove and take it out and sat it on top to the left of the stove. It was very hot. I sat it on the counter and it was bubbling. Marlene F came in and took potholders and checked something in the oven that she had been cooking. She looked at me kind of funny, and the dish I had removed from the drawer. I then realized that it wasn't a drawer that I took that out of. It was part of the stove, a broiler drawer, and the dish still needed to cook more. I explained to Marlene F what I had thought and why I had taken it out then I put it back in the oven/drawer. I had decided to rent some of the rooms to college students. This was going to practically pay my mortgage for me, even though I wasn't going to charge them that much. One of the people that was going to move in there, however, was Jo V. I was so excited that she was moving in, for a number of reasons. She is such a dear friend. She can help me in areas that is not a strength of mine, and it would simply be good to have at least one other person there that I know. There are a bunch of college students outside, standing in a row. I went out to talk to them briefly and tell them we're not quite ready for them to come in yet. I tell them that we are going to allow them to choose their rooms in the order that they registered and pay. They all began reaching for their payments. One Asian couple was going to share a room. They weren't married. They handed me a credit card. One I tried to process it, it was denied. I felt bad for them but needed to only accept students who could pay. Now I began wondering if I would be able to actually cash any checks these students give me. As I continue talk to the group I watch the Asian couple walk away, very dejected and worried. They don't know what they're going to do now. I later decide that I have an extra room and I go back outside looking for them. I see them walking along the road. I run to catch up to them and ask them what they plan to do now. They said they were going to try to get a ride to someplace where they could get some money. I suggested that they at least stay with me for the evening, no charge. I tell them they can help the cook in the morning with breakfast and dishes. I can tell they are very grateful for this so they walk back with me. As we're walking back I think about my intensives at GC. Everyone had to sign up to help in the kitchen for at least one meal during the week that we were there. I decide that it would be a good idea to make helping out a part of the rental agreement for all of the students. There would be assigned tasks and they could sign up for the tasks or shifts that work best for them and their schedules. I let them come inside but tell them they have to wait a bit to get their rooms. Jo V comes in and sits down her luggage. I take her on a tour of the house. We're admiring the nice wall-colors they choose. The upstairs looks very much like the scene of a dream that I had in October 2001. Only where the alcoves were in that dream were doors to the various rooms in this dream. It was almost like a large open lobby, with the doors of the rooms on three walls and the opening from the staircase on the other. I told Jo V I had dreamed about this space before and now here it is. I'm loving that. We walk around and look at the various rooms. The first room we look at only has a curtain for the door. It is the smallest and the most modestly decorated. I thought Jo V would probably take this one and let the students have the other rooms. The other rooms had doors. I was thinking about the small storage crawl space in Grandma's house that we used to hide in as children. I wondered if they had left that and was trying to remember what room it was in. I also remember that a number of the rooms had one or more smaller rooms, or storage areas, inside the individual room. I was trying to remember which room, or rooms, that was. I realized that I had designated that for my own room. It seems to change, sometimes in the dream it seems to be upstairs and at other times downstairs. When they refurbished the house they made the staircase much wider and made all of the steps from a beautiful knotty pine. Towards the bottom of the staircase it made a sharp left-angle turn for the final few steps. Those steps were each longer than the one before it, creating a kind of fan shape. We're talking about needing to finish up the painting. I called an expert and asked their opinion and they told me I should paint the baseboards and crown molding to match the wall colors but leave the door and window trims white. I had gotten a very small thing of paint, about the size of a matchbox except a tad longer. It was the pinkish-red color that was in one room. I had a small artists brush and I began painting one of the baseboards, toward the top so I could immediately see how well it was going to match the wall color. A little later someone came and asked me about it. I said I had put a little on there to see if when it dried it would be close enough to the wall color. I told them what the expert had said. They didn't seem to think that I was going to work, or not going to look good. I'm not sure which. The area now seems to be one long, very narrow hallway with all of the room doorways to my right. I see that the students have gone ahead and chosen their rooms rather than waiting for me. I see one girl lift a curtain and come out of her room. I look toward the ceiling at the curtain and realize that there is just one long curtain hung across the entire wall to act as a door for every room. That meant they had to lift the curtain from the bottom when going in or out of their rooms and risk disturbing those in the other rooms. I didn't think this was at all satisfactory. The house is attached to the children's museum. The alcoves in the October 01 dream were in the back section of a theater, behind the last row of seats. I see a wall with a somewhat hidden entrance. I decide to take Jo V and show her what is back there, acting like I know what it is when I actually don't. There is a woman in there practicing some type of event or performance with a combination of adults and children. I don't know who they are. The woman turns and looks at me and says, sshhh. I realize who she is, who they are, and what they are doing. [Don't know any of them in waking life.] There is another doorway, leading to yet another area behind this one. Again, I pretend to Jo V that I know what it is and take her back there. I realize this is the back stage area for the children's museum. We shared use of this backstage area. I was unclear as to whether I owned the entire building or just the house portion of it. But this means the scene has changed from being a country home in St. Joe to a city home in the city where I live. I lead Jo V back, quietly walking through the area where the group is practicing. I take her to show her another area. There is an entryway that is split. One way leads to my room and the other leads to a huge sewing area. I know she is going to love having this there. The left and front walls are lined from floor to ceiling with various fabrics. The right one or two shelving units are full of decorative trims. Along the right wall something else is displayed, related to crafts or sewing. In the center of the room is a large workstation. There is a woman there. She introduces herself as the staff seamstress. I immediately thought to myself that I cannot afford to have a full-time seamstress and wondered then if I had other full-time staff. She must have noticed a look on my face because she quickly said that I do not pay her salary. That her salary is paid through the sewing projects she does for my tenants. This was a very large and oddly shaped room. John, a male friend of mine is there. [I don't know him in waking life.] I am saying goodbye to him as he is getting ready to leave. He is headed off to do something in particular. It is political and is somehow related to Russia. He gets on a train and leaves. As I walk through the hallway past the room doors I see that there are a lot of young people in each room. I decide a lot of them must be visiting friends, but see that some of them are preparing to sleep on the floor for the night. I decide we need to have an initial house meeting to discuss rules and such, and then we need to have them on a regular basis. I tell them all we are going to have a house meeting in the morning right after breakfast. Some of them moan and roll their eyes. Others look at me like they don't know what I'm talking about and don't understand why we would need this. I tell them it's to let them know the house rules but also to discuss anything they want to discuss. For example, if one of them have allergies to fragrances we should all know that and try to respect it by refraining from using any kinds of fragrances around them. Or if anyone has something that is a real hot-button for them, we should know about it. We just want to get to know each other and try as best we can to respect each other and each other's preferences. It will help us to live together much more harmoniously. I decide that I'll also talk about signing up for tasks during the house meeting. The next morning I go down expecting to see the kitchen staff fixing breakfast. Instead, I see all of the students fixing their own breakfast. One is fixing peanut butter on toast. She has a special name for it, but I can't recall now what it was. I felt bad that they were having to fix their own breakfast, yet certainly didn't want to do it myself. There was very little room to move between the counters and stove and it was not well lit. There were probably fifty students there. I call attention for the house meeting. I realize that I need to get everyone closer together so I can see everyone and so that everyone can hear. I decide we'll go somewhere else in the house and wave my hand asking them to all follow me. The walls are now very curvy. When I get to where I want to have the meeting there is just a large carpeted area. I think it should be fine to ask them to sit on the floor. There is one obese girl there. I see a friend trying to help her sit on the floor. Before I can change my mind she is sitting so I decide to let it go. Many of the students have stopped further down the hall, around one of the curves and I can't see them. I start and decide I need them all closer together so I call those students to come to where we are. I realize there isn't room for everyone there so I walk further and instruct them to continue following me. We reach an area that looks somewhat like the lobby of a nice hotel or a very nice waiting room in a hospital. There are partial-walls every now and then, all curved. Some have sofas and chairs toward the middle of the room, semi-hidden on both sides by these partial-walls. Some have sofas and chairs along the outside of the walls. There are plants and it is very nicely decorated. I stop there and ask the students to find seats. Some will have to sit on the floor but I'm not concerned about that. I think some of them are still too far away but decide to just make the best of it. I had gone to ask the woman in charge of the children's museum if we could just use the auditorium for our meeting. Even though there was nothing going on she didn't want to allow it. I wondered again if I owned the entire building or just the house part of it. I begin talking. I have to talk loudly so they can all hear me. There is a floor to ceiling sheer-fabric curtain hanging along the wall I'm facing. I realize that the backstage area of the children's museum auditorium is on the other side. At first I don't think much of it because there is nothing going on there. As I talk I walk around the area. I look behind the sheers and see there is some kind of meeting or performance going on in the backstage area. I then tell the students they are going to need to move in closer together so I don't have to talk so loud and bother the people on the other side of the curtain. As I am talking I am also standing on some of the tables so the students have a better chance of seeing and hearing me. I occasionally step from one table to another, without stepping on the floor. The wall behind is made of glass panes and the train track is on the other side. I see a train pulling up. I jump off of the table and begin running along the wall with the train and looking through the glass to see who is in the train. I am hoping John is on it. I've been worried that he would be hurt and not return from his assignment. I see him looking for me from a window of the train. I get to the entrance and greet him with a hug. We chat excitedly for just a few moments, saying how glad we are to see each other and that he is okay. I introduce him to the students and tell them about the assignment he just returned from. When I mentioned Russia, many of the students began getting up and gathering their things. I ask them what they are doing and they say that are leaving. They are not just leaving the meeting; they are leaving the house - for good. They want no part of someone who is connected to this activity with Russia. I can tell many of the students don't know what to do, while others are fine with it. So I begin talking about his assignment and why it is such a good thing for all countries. A few of the students who had begun to leave decided to stay. I watch some of the female students continue to leave. They are wearing very glamorous evening gowns. One is a brown satin and has a train on it that has rows of ruffles on it and is sprinkled with rhinestones. I say something to someone about the inappropriateness of their attire. As we get on with our day, some of the students are bustling about, completing their assigned household tasks. Others are getting together to chat or study. I went and talked to the seamstress about replacing the curtain over their room doors. I told her if nothing else she could make separate curtains for each room, but I would prefer that they each have a door. She said she would talk to maintenance and see if we could do that within our budget. I went to my private living quarters. I am using the bathroom and someone just comes walking in. I don't know if she realized what I was doing. I leaned a bit to my left so I could see her and I told her that this is my private living quarters. She said something about the house map not being very clear about that. This happens one or two more times with 2-3 people coming in together. Now a girl comes in wanting to talk to me. I tell her that is fine. We'll just sit at my desk there to talk. After I've finished with her I went to find the seamstress again to talk to her about the door to my private living quarters. At first the door was a full wood door with a bubbled glass pane in most of the top half of it. On the outside of the door we had something printed on it to designate that it was private quarters. I realized that whatever was on it was not clear enough. Now it seems that the door is just a partial one, more like what you would see on a public bathroom stall with another alongside it. One leads to my private quarters and the other leads to the sewing area. We decide that students are getting confused and coming in the wrong door. But then it seems that there is just one door and the confusion happens when they come through the door and face two hallways. They choose the one to the left that leads to my private quarters instead of the one to the right that leads to the sewing area. Then I suggest that maybe we just need two separate doors. The seamstress is going to once again contact maintenance and have them take care of it. She will also have them change the wording on the door to make sure it is very clear that it is private quarters and they are not to enter. I suppose if I keep it locked at all times it would solve the problem. I'm not sure why this doesn't occur to me then, or why I don't want to do that. My private living quarters have the same curvy walls that were in the other area. Now the location is confusing, as it seems both Grandma F's home and my birth home both. Many of our family members are there. I hear someone shout that Hope and Faith have had their baby. They are relatives. [unknown in waking life.] I run out to the living room and see that the front door is standing open. I go to the door and see a sign, seemingly floating in the air, that announces the birth of the baby. I'm trying to figure out how that sign is out and there and floating like that. Someone points out to me that Daddy has it on a string so it is flying like a kite. The string isn't noticeable at all. I look to my far left and finally spot Daddy. He is running across the front yard because the sign is pulling him along. I'm surprised to see him running that well and it is not bothering him physically at all. It's dark outside. Daddy had been at the hospital with the father. Mother had been there too, but had driven herself because her and Daddy were either divorced or separated. Daddy was still living at our birth home. I don't know where mother was living. I wondered how it was for them to be at the hospital together. There are several cars in the driveway. Mine is one of them. Matthew is there and we are talking about various things. I have to go to work at CAS. I only have a few days left to work there and I don't want to be late and give them the impression that I don't care any longer, or that I'm no longer conscientious about being on time, etc. As I was trying to get ready Matthew kept coming in and asking me questions and talking to me. Most of the time I would have to stop what I was doing, turn my head, and ask him to repeat himself because I either didn't hear or didn't understand what he was saying. He said something to me about his room. I was surprised that he had chosen a room upstairs with all of the college students rather than having the room designated for him downstairs. I'm trying to put my makeup on. I put my mascara on and realize how long it has made my lashes. I look at the tube and see that it is one that I've not used before. I'm very excited that it is working so well. Then I realize they have gotten very clumpy. As I try to fix it I smear it on my cheek. I reapply it and then use my eyelash comb to separate the lashes. After I'm done I decide they look ridiculously long so I decide to try to remove and fix it. As I do the lashes on one eye ends up looking like a sparkling blue and the lashes of the other eye are a sparkling pink. I wonder if I can just go like this - if it's very noticeable. Matthew tries to tell me it's not but I can tell he's lying so I redo it completely. As I'm finally just about ready I realize that I have flight today to the SAID conference and I don't remember what time my flight is. I ask Matthew to go get my ticket for me. He says something, indicating that he doesn't want to and I say, please, in a begging tone. I know it's not going to be easy to describe to him where it is because it is a drawer in one of the small rooms inside my room and I haven't fully settled in at our new home yet. I do my best. The attic has been refurbished to house the student's rooms and that is where my private living quarters are also. He comes back and hasn't found it. Then I realize it is in the safe and tell him where the safe is. I realize I'm going to be an hour late for work. I decide that I'll call Bill C on the way and tell him that I'm running late because of the birth. I'm concerned that my car is blocked in and I'm not going to be able to get out. I found out that Bev was leaving at the same time and that was going to be enough for me to be able to get out. Daddy and someone were emptying things out of the back of my SUV. There were looking at it and talking about it being my new SUV. At that time it looked like a truck, but when I got in to leave it looked like an SUV again. As I got ready to pull out of the driveway I noticed there were cars parked to my left, all along the right side of the road, bumper-to-bumper. It was still just dusk, mostly dark. A car seemed to pull out of our yard from the left side of the road and heading towards me. I noticed it was an older couple. The man was driving and a woman was sitting in the passenger seat drinking a cup of coffee. I looked around to see why all these cars were around. At first I thought maybe one of the neighbors was having a yard sale but decided it was too dark outside, or too early in the morning for that. I went ahead and pulled out of the driveway headed to my left. Just after I did I realized that I had forgotten something and needed to go back to the house. I decided it would be easiest to just park along the road with the other cars and walk back. When I went back I couldn't remember for sure where I parked, or how far away. It seems that I walked two or three blocks. The area looked more like city blocks of an old, small town, than it did like the rural route that our birth home is actually on. Earlier I had been talking with one of my brothers and mentioned a local bar and deli that had closed. They asked me which one. I told them it was a small one on of the corners. It was a little mom and pop business. As I was walking to my SUV, I remembered this conversation and was trying to remember on which of these corners the business used to be. If I could remember then I could tell my brother more precisely where the business had been. As I walked I wasn't even sure I would know my SUV when I saw it, because I hadn't had it very long, it looked so much like so many others, and it was dark outside and little hard to see. As I walk I see about one hundred feet in front me is a large vehicle completely blocking the road. I immediately get upset thinking that this will be yet another delay in my getting to work because I'm not going to be able to get around him at all. I realize that he is moving out of the way. I walk back and forth two or three blocks trying to find my SUV. I see a man with a boat pulled perpendicular to all of the cars parked along the road. It looks like it is against an SUV. At first I think it's mine and I get upset and start looking at the SUV to see if there is any damage. There isn't but then I realize that isn't mine anyway."
"I am walking along and see Marissa Camden (died '91) coming toward me; I walk up to her: she looks happy, healthy, tanned and friendly. I tell her how glad I am to see her and kiss her hand. We walk together. She tells me she has been in New York at Art Colony run by BEVERLY (her daughter-in-law, who will be giving the keynote address at Nat'l Day of Prayer). She gives me all the info I need to go to that colony and suddenly I am in an ART STUDIO where Father Andrew is painting many small canvasses, boat scenes. He is busy painting, so I wait to tell him how good his reflections of the boat in the water are. (CF. WW painting) But before I can tell him, he climbs up a steep LADDER to a Loft to be with someone who needs help. While I wait, two young BOYS come along and start throwing the brushes around and threatening to smear Father Andrew's painting. I get so angry, I slap the boy and order him to pick up the brushes; he gets sassy so I bend down and help him pick them up. I say ""You know, Father Andrew is such a saintly man, he would not have wanted me to slap your face."" The boys are contrite and leave. Father Andrew comes down from the ladder and has to leave, but he promises to talk some more about the painting. (++ feeling, vivid)"
"Doctors were doing something to alter patients minds. Noah Wyle, an actor on ER, had found out about something that some of his coworkers were doing that was very wrong. They cornered him and took him to this upstairs location kind of like a loft. They significantly injured him physically, though I don't get the sense that they beat him. It was like they had put some kind of cuffs or something around his wrists and ankles and caused severe abrasions that were about 2 inches wide all the way around on each ankle and wrist. He was bleeding a lot. Down the middle of his chest were severe abrasions. He tried to sneak down to the locker room so he could clean himself up. He was trying to hide it so know one would find out what they had done. He was doing this to protect himself because they had done this to threaten him so he wouldn't report them for what they had done. He was putting on his scrubs and he had tied a whole lot of medications for his injuries tied to a belt. He was trying to hide them under his scrubs. A nurse coming in for her shift happened to look in and saw all the medications. He was talking to someone. That person didn't notice but this nurse did. Before that, I was talking to a supervisor. I guess I worked there. She had told me to check an ad and see if some things were still on sale. I had to stand on a wall heater or something to be able to look at an ad that was posted on the wall. I don't remember what it said but I decided from looking at it that the stuff was not on sale any longer. I never did go back and tell her that. She also wanted me to put out some new things on a shelf. She instructed me that even though the boxes were very attractive that I was to take the things out of the boxes to display them. There was a section of shelves where we displayed over-the-counter medication for employees. We kept them in the boxes. She wanted to make sure that I took these out of the boxes to display them. I went by one area that there were all kinds of hair care. It was large bottles. They were all green. Doctor B came by. I didn't say anything to him. I don't remember any conversation or anything. I just had the sense that he was there. I didn't do anything with the hair care products."
"Bob Mould's Pink Crush  I am listening to a Bob Mould CD on my stereo. I take all the CD's out of the stereo so it won't skip funny. The Bob Mould CD I put in is called Pretty in Pink, or Pink Crush or something like that. I have heard the first song that is played. The center of the CD player is oblong, like an oval. The CD's won't play correctly because of this."
"There's something in this dream, there's a large city. I won't say for sure but it reminds me of Boston to some degree. It could be New York. It could be anyplace. I'm a Fuller Brush man again. This time selling very much in the center of a city, apartments. The dream started when my boss picked me up to take me to my area to sell. I remember I parked my car, met him, and he took me a couple of miles through the city. He wants to go down expressways to this area that I was to sell in. In his car he had 2 daughters about 4 or 5 years of age. I can't remember too much of the details of the actual selling. It didn't seem as if it were too successful though. As I say, I was in apartment houses. After it was all over, I met him again and we started back. I remember he was telling me not to be too worried about the way I did because that area was quite hard to sell in any way. Then we started back on some expressway. We reached a very large hill and started down it. I remember he put the brake on to slow ourselves down because he was going about 70 miles an hour going down this hill. Just as he put the brake on, he seemed to almost just collapse. He moved forward and hit his head on the windshield, then just slumped down in the seat. Well, this threw the car out of control. I remember I didn't panic at all. I just merely reached over and grabbed the wheel. I kept us going straight. Then I had to push myself over on the seat and somehow managed to get him out of the way so I could get a hold of the brake pedal. This took a while, but I finally reached it and just as I was beginning to put the brake down to slow us down I woke up. I just might mentioned a few other things. The car we were driving was a '55 Ford. This is not the car that Moss has. He has a Corvair. Also the hill we were going down is certainly no place in Boston or no place else I've ever seen before. This is a monstrous hill. In front of us there were 2 trucks, so if we had gone out of control, it would have been quite bad. The daughters in the front seat, they were also in the front seat with me. There were 4 of us in the front seat, and they were frightened, but not too frightened. I guess that's about all. A few more things I remember about the dream. It was really cold, which was another thing that made me think it was a northern city. Also we were going down this hill, I can remember I was trying to get the car into neutral also. I don't know why, but I sort of tried to do it without the clutch too--just tried to pull the gear shift lever into neutral. It was a standard shift car. As for emotions in the dream, I would say it was fairly neutral even right up to the point where we were going down this hill. I can remember when this first happened. I thought what a terrible situation we were in, but then I controlled myself. I just said, ""Don't panic."" I just calmly tried to grab the wheel and push my boss out of the way so I could get to the brake pedal."
"I was flying. It was the best feeling in the world. I started drifting with the clouds, but soon I was really flying. I could control what direction I was going in. The clouds were blue, purple, orange, pink and green. They were diamonds. I landed on one of the light blue ones. When I got up and tried to fly again, I found I could not fly any more. I was falling."
"I'm meeting an old friend from high school and we're supposed to get married. Seems like it has been arranged or has to be done because I keep thinking in my dream ""I'm in love with Marc, why am I marrying Matt?."" Matt and I finally meet up. Neither one of us is dressed up or anything but there's no time for that, but I keep saying ""I can't get married without my parents here."""
"I'm in a small town and it is late at night. A woman is crying and complaining (dark-haired woman) because she told her secrets to a friend and they got returned to her with a cup of tea, meaning she felt betrayed because her friend told others. After awhile, I said to her, ""Oh shut up. Quit complaining, because you've got friends who care about you. If they didn't care, they wouldn't have been concerned and talk about you."" The woman got very upset with me and approached me menacingly with yogurt on her hands and took my hand. I said to her, ""If you intend to hurt me, I shall hit you."" Then I smear yogurt all over her hair. We laugh then and the tension is relieved. There are a bunch of neighbors in a line on the porch watching. We get into a conversation about people trying to be helpful and I argue with them that it is bullshit that it is out of good intentions that people help me. One woman cries and walks away. Some agree. A couple offer to help me into my bed and lift me up bodily and carry me through the window to my basement room I shared with another woman who talks about her boyfriend. Then it is hard to breathe. Oh, I hear a motor and we guess it's a VW bug or bus and it's an old man's wheelchair. Then it's hard to breathe and we see yellow thin strips of confetti-like stuff all in the air and we are breathing it in. It is in the air conditioning so we all get up and go outside where it is a hot summer night. A friend says, ""Come stay at my house,"" and I go, to find a woman and her two teenage children on the porch. She is crying and telling her children she can't stand being married to their father any more and she's leaving. The girl says, ""Please stay."" The mother says, ""I can't."" She leaves. I am laying on a mattress pillow and a small boy comes to take it in the house. It's his bed. I ask him if I can sleep on it tonight and he agrees, only if I let him borrow my manual wheelchair. I agree and he starts to cart it off. His brother -- both are dressed in tee-shirts and no pants -- pokes at the young boy's penis and smirks. I look, curious about its size and shape. Then I tell the boy, ""Please don't take the chair away now, because I may need it in the night and he can play with it tomorrow."" I wonder where I'll sit while he plays with it. The boy agrees and brings it back. The brother again smirks and pokes him in the penis, in a teasing, embarrassed way. They leave and I lay down wondering how far away this house is from Claude's. (The street is sort of like a summer vacation spot street.)"
"In the dream I had just woken up to get ready for class and I was in my dorm room. I got out of bed and went to the bathroom. In the bathroom there was a bed with my friend Nancy, who is 20, and her mother on it. It wasn't her real life mom. It was the actress from the TV. The mom kept trying to tell me something but I can't remember what it was. I just kept on wondering who this woman was because I knew that Nancy's mom didn't look like that. I eventually left the bathroom and was eventually in a hall where a lot of people from my floor had all congregated. Then I realized I had to go to class in the dream and I was late. That's when I woke up and realized that I actually overslept."
"A woman and I live together. She might be a daughter. She has a Chicano lover and she's afraid of him. He comes in drunk and has a gun that he threatens to shoot us with. I yell and grab the gun. He gets very angry and hits me and is going to badly beat me up. I dare him to try, but am inwardly afraid. I call him names. The daughter is a total wimp and angry at me for fighting back. I made him leave. I bring the gun in a lake. She says I should have to pay for it since I made it go away. I refuse and leave. He's following me and means me harm. I head for the M City house and go to the front door, hoping my father is around to help protect me. I see he is and I slam the door shut after I get in the living room. I yell, ""Call the police!"" As I lock the door. ""Dad,"" who looks like Grandpa Mildred, can't find the number. ""911,"" I yell. He tries, but is unsuccessful. The guy gets in and Dad doesn't do anything. Now the scene changes and he and my ""daughter"" have taken the deed to my place and are using it for their own. He's planted corn in my yard. I say to him, ""I know what you've done. It's illegal and I can get a lawyer and get back my land anytime I want."" He knows that, so he tries to be nice to me. I hold it over his head. If he doesn't ""take care of me right,"" I yank the farm out from under him. I don't trust him. I'm waiting for him to screw up."
"Meeting James At the Thomas'  I'm at my girlfriend Annie's house in a room that is not normally there. I am talking to Annie's sister Tina. Annie's sister Jessica and her boyfriend James are sitting on the couch. Later, I think the boy is the Thomas' cousin. Annie comes into the room. She has just gotten up from sleep. She asks me softly how long I've been here. She is angry that I was at her house and she didn't know it. She is on the cough, and I am on the floor next to the couch. We wrestle jokingly."
"I'm at a small but full-serviced post office near my home. I'm at a tall table standing there getting letters ready. I mail the letters and a man comes in and puts a beautiful picture of a woman on the wall and a sign beside it as to how to mail and address a letter accurately. She is dressed in fairly tight violet or purple blouse that shows her contours, and a white linen skirt (?) ... and I adore her honey-brown hair and steady gaze. Suddenly, another man comes in and puts a ""Give Blood"" sign over the instruction sheet and her picture stays the same, and the blood bank honors Emma for many years of giving a rare B- blood. And then a second man comes in and places, on table beside me, a small steamer trunk with brass fittings that holds the vessels for the collected blood."
"Last night I dreamt of the serenade we will give to a classmate. Strangely enough, the meeting was at her boyfriend's house rather than her own. It was a six-story building. We could see her mother and father, but it was his dogs that were there. He was also there. He is short, has black hair and brown eyes, and is a very good friend. She, the one being serenaded, is short, has long, black hair, black eyes, is dark and is an excellent friend. One of the dogs is brown and the other one is white. This dream is appropriate because on Saturday, the 29th, we are going to serenade her, but, contrary to the dream, at her house. I don't remember the other friends in the dream well."
"Fish Cleaning Boat  I'm in Alaska with my friend Norman Noman on a fishing boat. We're cleaning fish. There is little or no time to look at the beauty of the land. Norman and I are swimming. I have a knife. There is a lot of vegetation in the water. I see and come close to white-colored flashes in the water. Norman says these flashes are all muskies. I hear a very loud noise. Norman says it was a bald eagle. I don't see the eagle. The water gets shallower. It flows into a storm drain and into a ditch. A couple of small fish and a good-sized northern pike swim into the ditch. I go over towards them and they swim back into the shallow water. I throw my knife at them, but don't hit them. I'm at my friend Nate Nelling's house. Nate is not there, but his mother is. I tell my roommate Stephen Ramos not to touch Nate's father Walt's new motorcycle in the garage. There are some fishing poles there."
"I dreamt I was at the computer, and a boy bent over the to fix something.  I enjoyed the closeness."
"I was driving and being passed by my father on the way to my maternal Grandma Jane's house.  Then I was driving somewhere on a dirt path, and found that it was blocked off.  Another car was trying to turn around and I was going to have to as well."
With Brenda Hichman driving out to a lake: we swim in a canal of orange-brown water: amazingly clear. Meet Stan (her husband). He also swims. I wait a while for Frank but can't meet him. At home we have jerbils. I see the little ones separated from their mother. I take them and put them on the tiny nipple which they grab avidly. For two of them I have to find a nipple. Go to a lot of trouble to set up food and water for them.
"Big gathering at Church: many strangers: old men, rich people, etc. Father Andrew is preaching and there is a rebellion: people turn in their keys: throw their keys at him (like the stoning of martyrs) and they murmur against him. He is shaken and bruised, and I help him to a bed and arrange the covers, and wipe his brow, and he rallies. He thanks those who remain loyal, among them is Frank, who sits at his right in a chair and talks to him.
But only a few faithful remain, mostly women and children. He asks me to get him some pills, and hands me a big bottle with pills: finally he takes 2 blue pills; I go next door to a bathroom for 2 glasses of water; there is a big mountain of aspirins, and Reynaldo is there, he has to go to the bathroom. - Finally Father Andrew rallies and gets up and is able to give the congregation the Anditheran (bread). He asks me if he should wear a tie, since he lost his ""chasuble"" in the fray...."
"There is a McDonald's, quarter-pound cheeseburger. It is being sold and marketed and supposedly having no grease. I thought, ""How could that be possible!?"""
"Last night I had kind of an interesting dream. I dreamt that my Spanish class was hosting this party. I think it was for some new guests or something. And we were kind of at a place that was kind of like our house and kind of like something different. And we were arranging this buffet on our dining table, and I had given them two little Styrofoam balls and they crafted one to look like a pond and they put water in it, and they crafted another to look like a fountain. And they made this house out of cardboard with a big roof and white in the front, and they made it sort of longer than higher, and that was kind of a backdrop of the buffet. And I think I climbed up on the chair at the side of the table, and I grabbed the jug of water and I poured myself a glass. And then I went along down through the buffet and I got through these things. And I can't remember what the significance of all this was. There had to be more to it, but heck if I remember."
"We were at Grandma's. In the front room. I had been very very busy and tired. I had hung one art show and taken down another and instead of resting, My mother wanted me to go to church. I paused to rest on the way under the railroad tracks at the creek. Railroad ties were stacked up under there. A strange lady wanted to clean them up but I said, ""Don't, they're holding up the bridge."" Then we went to Grandmas, me and my mother and Rudy. My mother finally said ??? we have to go to church. People were there and strangers. Grandma was there. It was the front room. I was tired. A guy I didn't know, divorced with 2 children, told me, ""Why don't you get a beer from the window sill?"" and I pulled back the curtains and saw beer bottles and glasses of orange juice. Grandma had put them there for people who wanted beer. I took some beer and forgot where I put it. I was tired. I wanted to leave and go to sleep. Rudy didn't go to church. ??? a dark skinned lady who was lying told Dora she needed groceries for her baby and Dora believed her. I don't. I was mad that Dora helped her instead of taking me home to rest. They took the car and went away. I was looking for a specific type face on the computer to weave a story about 2 women, 3 men. I typed the letters and the letters turned into their clothes. It said Happy Birthday ___________.??? A famous artist, woman in a magazine, had a photograph in a magazine of an old pink chair painted pale pink. She had a picture of a penis only painted pale blue. She was about 100 years old. Only the penis, not the man, was in the picture. Dora was not back yet. When they came back, they had just gotten back from the Office Depot, changed cars and drove all the way to Greenville and I wanted to go home. Then the lady was stealing a burlap bag of vegetables with maggots, flies from Grandma's porch. An old old man from India was leafing through a scroll of writing--and knowing exactly where. Then the scroll became his robe. The knowledge from his robe became a book in 2 volumes, each about 10 inches thick. Miss Pat was Keith. Hank Finley was with Keith. I went to hug Hank. I didn't have a bra on. He said oh this is what he missed; he'd been divorced 15 years. Me and Dora and Rudy got in the car and we stopped to roller skate and the lady said, ""Couples only,"" and I was on the ramp. I said, ""I can't go down the ramp?"" And she said, ""No."" I took one skate off. Children with hardly any hair were milling around. The hair they did have was scarlet red and very silky and straight. Some were pale blonde--but hardly any hair. It caught the sun."
I was in a building where a wooden floor was being repaired. One floor in another room acted strangely. It would tip down and then raise into an odd position.
"I was with my mother and sister. Our car was on the road. My sister said she would park it at the corner. We were afraid she would not be able to do it, but she did."
"(05/05/97)[""Bill Cosby's Unusual penis.""] I see a naked black man in profile. He is in some argument with a white man. They are standing facing each other, the black man in a more defensive position. I am curious and look down to see if I can see his penis. It is long and thick, and hangs straight down. Then as I watch, it begins to snake around and I see that the tip is like an elephant's trunk, sniffing around. I think the black man is Bill Cosby, in his younger days."
"Two people were digging a path in the sand to channel water to flow to the ocean from a large house. There were two paths. The water flowed by the house. A fence of water was in the middle of the one close to the house. I asked my brother to push back the fence so I could walk in the water to follow it to the ocean. It was resistant but he could move it. I then waded to the ocean. I was disappointed to see that the water hadn't made it that far. I saw sand and dirt. I felt the channels were wasting water. I saw the ocean waves coming up the dry path and covered it all. Then there were a series of tasks I had to do to be able to leave the house and go on my own. I did these all successfully, except the last one which was very hard. I had to look at a picture and weave a reproduction of it. I attempted it but the weave was loose. It was close enough. Someone, a girl cousin, was snotty to me. I then was figuring out my monthly payments on my van. 7 to 9 months at $125 each month. $105 was principle and $20 was the finance charge. I figured I'd have it paid off in a few months (July or August)."
"I was standing on the bank of a small pond in which a very small yacht was located. The water was only waist deep and a boy of 20 that belongs to the young people's group I do was running through the water toward the boat. His clothes were blue. I walked along the bank and up the gangplank into the cabin. There was a mist in front of my eyes. I said, for I knew he was in there, I bet I know something. He said, what? I said, you're all wet. He said, guess again. Then I saw him smiling, stretched out on a couch with a cocky officer's cap and a light blue turtleneck tee shirt and blue dungarees. They were dry and not the same ones he had on before. I just stood there and the dream was over. His arms were folded behind his head. I had had several dates with him and he had walked me home from several of our Sunday evening meetings."
"I was reading apache bellyache will be traveling. That is all I read when I awoke. Carl Fisher and I were surrounded by a gang of gangsters of Mexican bandits and we were getting captured and marched into a big hall. Guns were taken and there was only one way I saw to escape. I started to fly and one of the bandits gave me a shove, which gave me a good start. I flew to close windows and then I flew back to the doors and I escaped. Fisher in the surprise of me also escaped. We were crossing a field where there were cows and one cow started to charge us. We started to run for the fence in flight. Fisher said, ""Shoot your gun."" I said, ""I have no gun,"" but I put my hand into my pocket and felt a small gun. We got under the wire, then walked over where the bandits were in the big hall. They were inside, afraid of us. We had our two guns. People were going in and out of the hall and they gave us respect."
"I'm teaching class. One of my students is questioning something. I'm being patient. Co-worker Josh and Pedro come to see me. They are full of some news or concern. They show me a large board with metal bars displayed on it. These are the new bars for the jail. They strike the bars and musical notes sound. It's very pretty. They say, ""But, well, radical Feminists."" I say, ""I don't understand."" They look embarrassed. One says, ""You know what we mean."" I say, ""No, I don't. Please explain."" They start to explain but it's confusing. It's something about how awful it will be to have radical Feminists in the same jail as the physically disabled. Contamination, bad stuff. I am a little amused by them. I say, ""I still don't understand."" They say, ""Wait, we'll get something and come back to explain."" They leave. I feel that they are leaving to get more at ease so they can come back and not be so embarrassed. There are 2 metal boxes. They are hot. It's a train. A little girl gets out of one box. Then a metal tong reaches into the second box. Many letters and papers and money are pulled out. The metal tongs are necessary because everything in the box is so hot. The papers and financial stuff are cooling. There is a feeling that the little girl is poor and an object of fun."
"Uncle Willis is singing a song and Aunt Muriel joins him. They are wearing clown makeup. Patricia is talking. It's Terence's funeral. I sit up front facing Patricia. Lots of people seated, like at a banquet."
I was living in a house. Children on their way to school were cutting through our property.
"Under a dark night sky, I am sitting outdoors at a large, popular music concert with a group of friends. The seats are the overly soft, somewhat worn, but very comfortable chairs that are found in many old movie theaters. My friends and I are all sitting in the same row listening to the music, which is very loud and is being perfomed by the ""Mammas and Pappas"". Their song intoxicates the entire audience. One row in front of us some people stand up and sit down to form a ""wave"". This wave is carried everywhere and I feel the chair I am sitting in rhythmically rise and fall every few seconds, as if it were floating on a sea with real waves of great height. This is a pleasurable thrill, a joyous release, and I am ecstatically carried away in the motion of the chair, the loud music, and the happiness of everyone around me. This physical high lasts for quite a while."
We can't meet Father in Japan but you had better find out when his plane leaves. He phoned but I didn't find out when we should leave to meet him. (Impression that we were in China.)
"I was in this very large house. It belonged to very wealthy people. Some young people were having a party here. I don't think their parents knew about it. Perhaps it was an after-prom party, but I'm not sure. Many of the kids were making-out in several of the rooms. Particularly, I found a couple in one of the bedrooms. I was wondering through the house, simply because it was such a large, expensive home and I was interested in seeing all the rooms. I would go up a flight of stairs and the only room would be another bedroom. Another flight of stairs, one bedroom. Etc. I did this several times. On one floor of the building, the bedroom was all white, the furnishings, and everything. It was more like a suite. The front room, I think, was the bathroom and then led into the area where the bed was. In the bed area, the walls seemed to be covered with white billowy curtains. For some reason, I think there were two beds, side by side, instead of one. This doesn't make sense to me because this is the room where the owners of the house would go to make love. Maybe I'm not remembering it right but it just doesn't feel right. I don't know if it was one large bed or two twin beds. Anyway, the bed(s) face an extremely large Jacuzzi. It is the walls around the Jacuzzi that have the white billowy curtains. I thought what a beautiful room this was. But there were no other furnishings or decorations in this room. Just the beds, the Jacuzzi, and the curtains. I think I may have been with someone as I was later checking all the rooms. I don't know if I was checking to make sure everyone was gone or if I was looking for someone. Actually, I think I was looking for someone, but found individual people in more than one bedroom."
"Joe Sizemore had been going down a list of names and when he came to mine he asked if I had played football the year before.  I said no, only baseball-except I believe I said I had substituted for Larry Poponovo at end a couple of times when he was sick.  Coach said he wanted me to come out for football that year.  I told him I would, not so much because I wanted to -- I knew I couldn't stand practicing every day -- but because I was flattered that he would ask me.  The next name he called on the list was Tommy Jacobson."
"I was with my mother in a European city. A man told us to look up at a sign. It was a sign spelling out words that move from one end to the other. It was spelling ""Peace on earth."""
"I'm on some kind of tour bus, going from one place to another to accomplish tasks. One stop is the hand surgeon to look at my hands. I see a mechanical mama going up stairs. A small mechanical baby rides in her wagon (her back) a ""toddler"" sized wheel is attached on the back and it's going faster than the mama and has to slow down or get cramped up uncomfortably. They bounce uncomfortably up the stairs. Now I'm on a bus. We stop. I say, ""Is this place accessible."" I see a ramp. The bus driver thinks there are a few steps. I remember I'd been there before and decide not to go now. Josh is near the back of the bus and decides we'll all skip this stop, but four or five women get off anyway and we drive away. Josh is concerned that we will forget them and leave them. So I memorize the address, 4th and main. We go to the next stop."
I am lying on a couch and can hear myself struggle for breath. I get up and call out for my mother to help me. No one seems to pay attention. I get up to find her. I find my pills and try to eat them. I become concerned I might not take the right ones.
"I was in a movie watching it very intently. When the movie was over, I discovered I had dropped some article which I had been holding. But when I tried to look for it, I found my eyes would not move from their previous position of looking up at the movie. I tried hard for a long time to get them unstuck finally they did."
"I and Valerie are sitting in a chair together and my mother is seated in another chair. she tells a story about Jake when he was a baby. She relates that someone noticed his tail wrapped around her breast when he was nursing. I suddenly say, ""Oh, what an incredible metaphor."" She looks at me suspiciously, with huge eyes with enormous pupils, and says, ""Is this going to be profound?"" I sigh with frustration. She never understands. I try to explain, ""When other people say 'space,' you hear that you are at fault."" She does not understand and I am frustrated at her again."
"Last night I had a really crazy dream. First of all I dreamt that I was in this classroom at my tech school that had desks in it, but everybody like moved to the front of the room and was listening to a lecture about something, I don't remember quite what. But I kind of, somebody told me that this was normally a Pro Tools lab, but it was going to be a lecture room for today. And we were having a lecture about Midi (?) and they were going to play us this sequence and solo out different parts, and have us listen to the way the different parts combine, and they did some of that. And -- oh, next thing I know, all of these people are at our house in my home town and we're, the instructor is there and everybody is there, and we're trying to build this same sequence and they have like a synthesizer, I guess. For this part when we were in our living room, it was this big stocky synth in the middle of our rug and everybody was all crowded around. And next when my mother and my father walked in [part unhearable] and there was like a bunch of stuff, and they just basically did some cleaning up and all because all of us are really into what we're doing. Oh, and the next part is really good. I dreamt that it was time for me to be in lab, and so I was in lab. And my mother was there with me so that when I need to find something on the screen and I didn't know where it was, she would point it out to me. And when I work on the computer and my mother is there, I'm really lazy because there's something that I want to find, like a document or something and I open the folder and I say, ""Okay, where is this?"" and she points to it and I go right to it so I don't have to, because I could find it myself, but I just say, ""Okay, where is this?"" and she points to it and I go right to it and we go from there. So I dreamt that she was there doing that for me in lab, and it was really crazy because we had to go to the start menu and select various views or sections for various examples, and I was having a hard time selecting the right one. And each one had like something different on the desktop and then when I opened up the sequence program, she would help me find certain little things that I needed to find. I don't remember what program we were using, but I just remember being glad that she was there. And then after a while she went to sit in the back of the room, and chat away with the instructor just like she used to do when I was in middle school or high school sometimes. And then I woke up."
"It took place 10 days ago, but it was about my fifth grade class. We had taken a field trip to my grandfather's house for some reason, only it was at San Diego, not San Jose. Anyway, when the tour was over (I don't remember the tour) me and my girlfriend went to go eat ice cream. Mine was bubblegum. I hate that flavor. Then she disappeared with her father in a blue plane. I looked all around, but no one was around me. I was afraid that no one would come back for me. Then a huge swarm of butterflies and bees attacked me. I screamed in my dream, but my dad woke me up and said it was time for school."
"I dreamed that one day I came back from school and I was on the bus. Then my friends said ""Gosh, every day when our bus gets off here to drop you off, there is a car full of guys waiting for you!"" I said, ""No, they might just be waiting for someone."" I was a little afraid but then I got off the bus and they followed me. Then I walked faster, then I opened the door and ran upstairs and walked into my house and locked the door."
"I go to a concert or some other event in the car with Sharon.  I also take Ronnie Nadner and someone else.  I figure Ronnie will ride back with someone else, but when we go back to the car, he comes along.  We are supposed to go to CYF (Christian Youth Fellowship) that night.  It seems like Ronnie is going to that too.  Anyway, driving back, we are passing through some clean, green hills.  The highway doesn't wind around the hills like a regular highway but back and forth with switchbacks, and so we can see most of it most of the time.  Sharon says she had better go to her brother or her sister's house.  I don't like this, because I have planned on taking her all the way home.  I also feel kind of funny to find out that she has a brother and a sister.  She seems to be surprised that I didn't know it.   Pretty soon Ronnie asks me if I am not taking her home.  I tell him I have to take her to her sister's house.  Then they both say that she has changed her mind and was going home, and that she had said so about 15 minutes earlier.  The gas tank registers empty.  Sharon is either driving or backseat driving.  We pass up several filling stations and go to one that is kind of out of the way.  I buy $1 worth of gas."
"I looked at the paper and saw 334 or 344 just at a glance for bonds. Andy P. was building to his house. He had fresh concrete on a wall and was troweling it out fast before it got hard. I was going to replace some old part of my basement. Ann and I were in the basement. She was laying nude and I was tempted to do it to her, but I resisted her advances. Ann and I were to meet again and I waited for her, but when we met, there was someone around. I had a funny loose and low seat in my car. I was getting ready to drive it. Cousin Helen had a small dog. He did his business on the floor in two rooms and so much you wouldn't think a small dog could do so much."
"I am in a tree, and Nancy is standing on the ground. I'm handing her papers from the tree, and she's reading them. They are dreams (written on the papers). It was fun sitting in the tree handing her dreams."
"(3/21/83)(At the Retreat Center) Our house is full of people and I receive a good-bye present from the president of the Jung Assn.: she gives me Lilies of the Valley and a GOLD PIN for my blouse. we are at our home in M. City and it is a hot day; our children are still young and just want to play around in the yard; I notice that our next door neighbor's house is being demolished; why? - shift: Frank and I are on INISHERE (the island where Wendy lived for 3 years in the 70's) we visit Wendy's former landlord and their daughter who is taking care of a baby, not her own.... vague ending."
"I first dreamed that I was watching an outdoor movie and Ezra was there, lying right next to me. I rested my head on his shoulder, and next thing I know, he is kissing me all over! Then Mrs. Glove walked near us and we went to the athletic center to get away from her. Then I was in a huge house with everyone from school. We were watching a movie and I told one of the freshman boys to sit next to me. I slipped off my seat, and everyone started making fun of me for having big boobs. Then all the girls went to shower, but for some reason, Ben was outside the bathroom, so they couldn't. Cecily couldn't work on yearbook, so she asked me too. Then the Nazis were chasing us and it was horrible. Everyone went on a cycling trip without me, and I was left behind with all the Nazis. Thank god I woke up."
"The Little Blimp  I'm driving in a mountainous region to go mountain climbing with my friend Kevin Simpson. There is a man in a Subaru wagon that is going west, camping. He has a tent in his car. We go east and turn right onto the second road. A sign says it is five miles to the place where we want to go, which seems to be a place where fossils can be found, and also a small bakery. The sign is for the first right, and I wonder if I'm going the wrong way; if I've gone past the road. I drive fast down a gravel, windy, hilly road. Kevin is in the car behind me following. It's difficult to keep my car on the road because I go so fast. We arrive at a beach area. There are people painting on a wall. There is a preacher-like person there. This seems to be a religious-musical cult. The atmosphere seems to captivate or suck Kevin into it. People try to make us stay: to detain us. We throw fruit and fight, as they do. My former supervisor Ron Fontana is a leader-type man. People throw large tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, and berries. I hit Ron with one, and it knocks him back. He throws a green pepper-like fruit at me. I catch it. There is a large sand hill in this place, about 20 feet high, and a water hole that is like a miniature quarry, next to it. There is a key and a board near the water. It may be just above the water, hanging or hovering. I'm frantically trying to escape. I scurry up the sand hill and dive to get the key. I almost lose the key in the water because I have a poor grip on it. There is a very shaky wooden bridge running from the top of the sand hill to a place. This seems like an escape route. Kevin is there, in a blimp. The blimp is about three feet long, and dark in color. There are two teapots connected to the blimp. This is an escape. I grab onto the teapots and hang from the blimp as it rises. Another younger man wants to go too. I tell him to grab onto my foot. We rise, and I notice it seems like we are floating in my kitchen at home in Oak Valley. I think it will be tough to leave, if possible."
"I am in the wilderness with a man (he's like Clint Eastwood). There is some attraction but I don't trust him so I rebuff him, and keep him at a distance. He starts to make love. I say, ""Don't, I'm not interested in just sex, I want you to care about me."" We're a little frustrated and angry with each other. I look up. There is a big hill and a cave. I go through the cave entrance and inside the cave is an open, grassy warm, hillside. The top of the cave opens to the sky. I have to travel to the top of the mountain to see what's on the other side. I go there. There are rooms. Some people are there. I don't trust them but they seem to be the ones that can transform me to a better being. One starts operating on me. He cuts me open. I'm now watching the operation near by. He messes around with my organs. I ask the person being operated on if it hurts, as they are awake. He or she says, ""No, I've got acupuncture, and I don't feel it."" It looks awful, blood and guts. The head is worked on. The person can now see and understand better. I step outside to see what's on the other side of the mountain as I'm now at the top. Fog, unclear, a sense of cold, and some uneasiness."
"The Tri-Locked Gate  There is a man in the bathroom at my neighbor the Jones' house. He tries to escape out a window, but he is very broad and large. The place is a school. The man is then a boy, and he flees down a hall and out a doorway where some administrators are. The administrators aren't happy that the boy is trying to get out. The area outside the school is fenced in. The boy runs up to a gate that is locked in three places: the bottom, middle, and top. A woman is at the gate with the keys. She is slow to open the locks: not swift and precise. There is pressure from behind the boy."
"I am in the basement of a house near a staircase. Some man is coming down the stairs and collapses. He releases, as people do upon death, and I get feces all over my hands. It is full of worms. The worms get under my skin on my hands and I am trying to pull them out."
"Robert Urich is also a gourmet chef, and he's gotten into a bet with a famous-chef friend of his that he can do something just as fast his way as his friend can. They set up a private contest, and Robert wins. All quite friendly, but the friend puts on a little miff. Robert has long hair at the moment, which he is lately wearing in a ponytail. I have been sent to go get something - his trophy? - and go to this building with an outdoor patio or something, next to a bit of parking lot, a level up, maybe head-height, and as I skirt this there's a fluffy white cat and I'm hearing (or singing) ""Grizabella"". I have the idea this cat is called Grizabella; I think, it's kind of a matter of taste, huh, somebody thought she was a glamour cat. But she is pretty. Inside, I'm looking for something in Lorren's apartment when she comes in - I'm surprised, I thought she was gone and I find myself thinking she thinks I shouldn't be here. Then I go to collect the (trophy?) and Robert Urich comes bustling in to get it himself, and I'm confused, but he's never one to do things the simple way anyhow - he's always like this. Later I'm going somewhere in a neighborhood and I see 2 guys I know, one of whom says something that the other should know, but as I pass him and call out, he doesn't hear me or doesn't respond. Typical of him. Later, I'm talking to someone (who's probably a therapist) - Jill and her roommate have just been here, and their problem is Jill's gotten a job managing a rock band and her being up all hours is bothering her roommate."
Coasting down a very steep hill with two others. I go twice taking turns with one of them. Climb up hill gets me out of breath so I quit.
"(04/23/01)[""Traveling with the natives.""] I'm traveling down a dirt road in an Asian country. All the peasants are walking and I am riding a very tall plastic blow up animal. It is mechanized so it moves along. I am way up higher than everyone. The animal is a sort of black ostrich looking thing. I come to a bridge over the road, like another highway going perpendicular. I am too high, so I push a button and the hydraulics of the machine shortens the thing enough so I can get under it. The peasants ignore me, they do not like having me there. They do not respect me. Later, the peasants are running toward the fields and I hear an airplane coming. I realize I am in danger and shorten the machine down to the road and then run with the peasants into the weeds in the field. We hide until the airplane passes. We come out. I see shimmery pamphlets lying all over the road. They could explode if we stepped on them. I now get off my machine and pick up clothes and shoes from dead people on the road so that I am now dressed and acting like a peasant. It is my protection. We come into a room. I am more accepted now."
"I was walking through deserted streets. I went into a department store and rode on an elevator with some friendly high school girls. Later I told my mother about the girls, but she did not approve of my talking to them."
"Someone is trying to kill me. I was in my house and it actually looked like my house did about 7or 8 years ago. In the dream I wake up, realized there were people trying to break into my house. I ran around locking all the doors and windows. It was morning, I was alone. Suddenly I remember a door I had forgotten to lock, but as I went to lock it, the 'bad' guys were already coming in. They were male, ages 25-35, about 3 or 4 of them, dressed all in black with burglar masks on. I knew immediately that they were there to kill me, in particular, not to rob the house. I ran into my parents' room and locked the door, then tried to climb out the window, but there was a man standing guard outside, he didn't see me (it's on the 2nd story), so I edged along the trim of the house, jumped down around the corner from the ground and ran to my neighbors' house. I pounded on the door, they let me in, I told them to lock the door and call the police, but as the door was closing, the murderers burst in and started chasing me. I hid in a pile of clothes. They almost found me, but in the end didn't."
"I am going to River City for a week.  It seems as though I am going to go on the plane and Uncle Joe is going to pay my way, which I don't feel right about.  But I am walking and have been walking for some time-roughly the distance from church down Marble, down Wistful to Harrison, and through City Park until about Malabe Park-though it seems farther.  It seems to be both approximately that route but also, at the same time, a dusty country road toward a big hill sort of like a road toward Jagged Mountain on Joe Duggan's paper route.  I suddenly realize that I am not taking any luggage and the only pair of shoes I am taking is my old tennis shoes.  I am hesitant at first about going back, but then I remember my job appointment (from the previous dream), so I turn back immediately.  On the way (on Wistful, I believe), I pass a little store with a little car I recognize in front of it.  I go inside, and Uncle Ben is in there buying something.  The roof isn't very high and slopes down below head level.  I am glad for the opportunity to get a ride back.  Technically, the car doesn't really look like Uncle Ben's, but it is very familiar, and I associate it with him."

"I see Frank as he comes in from the outside; see a hill side covered with autumn leaves and red maple trees. We (who?) tells Frank he is a dictator. I get very angry at him and stuff his mouth with leaves.
- Visit Julia H. (neighbor). It is very cold; ice and snow; I return home as she has company.
- Mrs. Lemnos and her husband come to our house. Mrs. Lemnos (ANNA) asks about leaving some blue shoes. I say, ""I will look for them."" But instead find 8 combs, old and broken... on a baby grand PIANO...."
"I was walking with another man and I was carrying a little boy. We came to my house, and as I started to enter, he asked me if I would walk with him to his house. As I reflected on his request, I felt a titillating sensation in my solar plexus. I agreed to go with him. Later when I went into my house, strange people were there. The door was open. I was afraid we had been evicted."
"People looking at a painting of Christ with halo weeping on MARY THEOTOKOS' shoulder, they say: ""We have failed"" -- contrition."
"I was sitting in Prof. B_____'s class taking an exam. My girl friend was sitting next to me, taking the exam also. Professor B_____ walked in the room with a woman - he introduced her to the class as his wife. They sat up in front of the class and whispered to one another. I finished the exam before anyone else and then went up to the front desk and sat between Mr. B_____ and his wife. They continued to whisper behind my back - I tried to hear what they were saying but couldn't figure out what they were talking about. Suddenly a bee flew into the room - my friend was frightened and stopped writing her exam - the bee then flew out of the window and she continued writing her exam. I walked up to her and asked her why she was writing so much - as I had written a very short exam ... she continued writing. I then walked back to the front of the class and sat down with Mr. B_____ and his wife. This time I did not sit in the middle but besides Mr. B_____. He and his wife continued to whisper. I recall that I was ""all dressed up"" - wore high heels instead of bobby socks - also wore one of my best dresses. Interpretation My friend and I often discuss Prof. B_____. We often discuss his views on politics and religion. I know he isn't married and we often discussed the type of woman we thought he might marry. Concerning the dress I wore - I wore that dress the previous evening when out on a date the dress caused much comment.  I cannot figure out what the bee meant. Answers to questions 2. Happy and at times a bit perplexed3. Actual participant4. Pleasant5. In a classroom at M_____ (where I have a class under Prof. B_____)6. No7. I was conscious of the color of my dress and shoes - royal blue dress withred belt - also red shoes (which I actually possess)."
"The dark-haired woman has a big bottle of perfume they had bought at the butt watching fair together that was supposed to be long lasting. A leak springs up in the bottle and she pours the perfume into another container. There is no smell; they were duped. She decides to return to the fair and demand her money back. She enters the library. A man with a disabled foot (there are two that work there) asks what she wants. I (now her) say, ""I want to complain to the fair committee and get a refund."" He asks my name and limps off, his foot looking like he'd been trapped in a ski boot remover. I follow and stand by three men reading books who comment on Michigan being a place where people can go to a meditation conference. I say, ""Well, that makes good sense in the winter, a good place to do it."" I hear my name called, ""Barb Sanders,"" and look up and see the fair committee walking by saying, ""And Barb Sanders has a complaint to put before us as well."" I realize I'm on now. Short notice but oh, well. We enter a room and I sit. It's a conference room (see drawing). I sit. He asks me to tell my story and tell what I want. I do and as I go on, he interrupts me. They grant me my money back and I feel annoyed he interrupted me until I fairly realize I was being long-winded and had got my point across already. I Leave. Now, the men are talking about holding their own butt watching contest and making lots of money, but my guy is thinking of declining. It's not as fun as just being as contestants, and besides a man newly married should be home watching his own beloved's butt!"
I just had a dream about Kevin...
"Congratulations, I got married last night! But the girl I had only been out with twice before we decided to get married. Right after the wedding, her father, as a wedding gift, gave me the keys to a new car. But I had just bought a new car, a ""VW,"" for our honeymoon. This was a conflict. Either take his car or take mine. Things didn't quite work out. I got unmarried, I think, before I left the church."
My husband goes to bed and I am waiting for my old boyfriend. I go to see if the boyfriend is on the couch. He isn't. I go outside and see some kind of weird plane in the sky. It comes down and I see it is my boyfriend and another man. It is some kind of important invention. I am taking pictures of my boyfriend's father and the flash keeps falling off my camera.
"(08/26/64) I was mad at my husband because he was inviting these absolute strangers over for supper, and the fancy meal of beef stroganoff I wanted to fix for them, they didn't like because they didn't like rich foods. The family consisted of a man and woman, and an older fat woman who dictated to the others what they were to do. She wore a fantastic long gown of pink satin with gold around the neck and throat. I kept asking people if she didn't belong to some religious order and they kept saying no, but I knew she must belong to some secret order."
"Scattered frenzied images. I am angry at a man and I walk down stairs and gather up my videos and things and take them back upstairs. He yells, ""Not my TV guide."" He's furious and chases me, throwing things and pouring salt and pepper at me."
"My mother and I were driving through western New York State. We went through Rochester and could see lake Ontario in the distance. We then arrived in Freeport on our way to Erie. Somehow we had the idea that this was where the two lakes joined. We drove beside Lake Ontario through the little town and beside a very marshy section. A little ahead of us was a hill and we supposed that Lake Erie was on the other side. We saw a bridge going over the point where we entered the town. Just as we were about to turn around the hill, my alarm rang and I was very angry. I did want to see how the two lakes joined."
"Abner comes to visit me. I am sitting on my single bed. He comes and sits on it as we talk. Then he tries to come closer and I open the covers and say, ""Come on in, it's OK."" We lay together, still talking. We cuddle and as we talk, he lays down the opposite way and pulls me on top of him. I am sitting up looking down at him. We are talking about the V family. I say to him, ""I'll probably spend the rest of my life thinking about how the V family has influenced me."" The dysfunction and the ways they taught us we were not good enough through negativity. Then I say, ""You don't agree with me, do you? You don't think they were bad?"" He says no, he doesn't agree. I say, ""I know they meant no harm. I love them and always will, but the style of communication was negative and nonsupportive."" He shrugs and says he doesn't agree. Now he gets up. Somehow the nearly sexual postures we'd been in feel uncomfortable for him. He walks around."
"Reynaldo is still a small boy; I get ready to go out but see a car parked in our alley, whose? Reynaldo has gone over to the neighbors; I leave him a note and worry about what he is going to eat...."
"My boyfriend Jeremy and I were an in an interesting gym with an odd sort of game of tennis going on.  Some of the players were sitting.  There were goals on either side of the court on one side, but not the other.  They were using a ping-pong ball.  It wasn't limited to four players.  There were people sitting in the audience with a green outfit on that were also playing.  Because of where I was sitting near the back line, I was expected to play as well, although I didn't know that at first, until someone got after me for missing it when it came towards me.  There were two courts side by side, but in different rooms.  You could go upstairs and watch from above, too.  I think it was supposed to be my boyfriend Jeremy's old school.  We thought the sides should be even so if one has goals on the sides, the other should too; Jeremy went downstairs and started pulling one out.  A little later on we went down the stairs to leave, and met up with my godmother's family the Swensons.  We were with some other people as well.  I think my parents were there.  We passed through two halves of a fake mountain, and the older son Milt wanted to push them together.  His father told him that the people inside would suffocate.  There was more to do with Milt, but I can't remember it."
"There was a girl with flippy blonde hair in a poofy white dress. I couldn't be sure if it was her prom night (that) she was trying to get ready for or (if) it was her Halloween costume and she was a fairy godmother. A tennis shoe was stuck to the skirt part of her dress. The shoestring (tie end) was stuck and the shoe was floating in the air. She was perplexed. I couldn't waste any more time looking at her and her predicament. I'd already let the lawnmower choke down once for watching her and it was HARD TO CRANK. I had lots of grass to cut that day. I kept having to turn the blade speed down because it kept going faster and faster. The blade was so low to the ground and CHINKING on rocks--""chink, chink"". The speed setting was getting higher all the time. My knuckles were vibrating from the push lawnmower. Then the higher blade was getting lower. My knuckles were getting white. Then the Chrysler Building was opened after hours for a big party. I opened the huge window blinds to view the entire city. In the center of the ""Cloud Room"" were bump cars. They looked fun. 2 girls of ambiguous sexual preference were wrestling and having fun. One especially had very sleek, defined leg muscles. In the stadium--bleacher part ??? people dancing. The crowd hushed when the James Earl Jones's reading of Edgar Allen Poe's ""The Raven"" began. It was the version from the Simpsons. ??? basement. Me and Sarah squeezed through. Sarah and I went to the basement and tried on swirly printed cheaply made long dresses. A sign said, ""As a matter of fact, keep on top of what's happening. You probably lived in a previous century."""
"3 women in a house. They were given pretty white ""ribbons"" for their hair. One wore a white gown, and threw the white ribbon down on the ground. She broke it. She said it made her look too old. Some male figure was bossy, angry. Indians attack. We hide and fight in the house. We make a run for the car (an old Model T). It has gas. We drive (flat tire), country side (orange leaves like of fall, but it's supposed to be desert-like)."
"I was being examined by a patient. I was clad in my underwear. He gave me a low rating, and I complained. He said my organ had been showing through my shorts. I apologized, and he raised my score from 2/3 to 3/2."
"I was at some large gathering like a picnic, in the middle of a large field; as a matter of fact, it was near the Fairgrounds in my hometown, because I remember pointing out the ""Golden Thriller"" statue to Bonita.  We didn't know our way around very well, and decided we could guide on that statue as a reference point to get where we wanted to go.  Anyway, at some point, we were all in cars in the middle of this big field.  It was damp and rainy, and we may have been just getting in out of the rain, or we may have been preparing to leave.  On my home, though, either then or later, I was on foot."
"My first dream was that we were in the town where I grew up, and I went over to a girlfriend and she told me that my mother was sick in the hospital. The place where this happened was the same as that place was after an earthquake that took place."
"I was in a large library and among ancient liver-spotted volumes. A tall, handsome scholar picked up and put down the heavy volumes. I knew him to be dying of a bad heart, the time unknown. He resembled both me and Robert Graves. He then picked up a hammer and pounded on a desk or table. At each blow, I would not have been surprised if he had dropped dead."
"I was at school, I think. I was sharing a bed with Father Nick and Bart H. Not intimately, just sleeping. Bart H slept in the middle. For some reason, one night they were in bed already and I tucked the sheets and blankets in all along my edge of the bed before getting in. I then was having a lot of difficulty getting under the blankets, while they just lay there and watched. Someone else came in the room and said something and then left. Later we were in the airport going home. Actually I think I was in my home airport but it didn't look like it, but several others that I was traveling with were there too, although they aren't from Indy. We were having trouble figuring out where we needed to go. All we kept seeing were restaurants and retail businesses. We went up some escalators and then back down. We finally found out that we needed to go to the ticket counter to get baggage claim tickets. We got in line. There were four of us. I was first in line. When it came my turn they all pushed their way in front of me. I was aggravated by that. At first the ticket counters were very high so you could barely see the people working behind them. When I finally did get to the counter I asked how that had happened and she didn't have an answer for me. While she was taking care of me a group of young girls clamored around the counter pushing me out of the way. Then I got upset again and said something. They felt I was getting upset for no reason but moved a little bit to allow me back to the counter. the counter was the height of a normal airline counter. I left the counter and headed for my car. Oddly I had just one small bag on a portable luggage carrier. I struggled a bit getting the carrier up the escalator. I was in a hurry so I was trying to walk up the escalator rather than just riding it up at it's own pace. I was following a man who was doing the same thing. It felt like someone behind me was watching me critically. It seems that there was more to this dream about steps and escalators but I don't remember the details. I went outside to find my car. It was dark and I couldn't remember where I parked. I wondered if I had written it down on something in my bag but for some reason I was stopping to look. I thought I was fortunate that it wasn't a big parking lot, so I just kept wandering around looking for my car. I encountered a man, maybe two men, in the parking lot who said something to me. just being friendly. The parking lot was on the slant of a hill and there was lots of dirt and grass around. The lot itself was gravel. I woke up before I found the car."
"On steamer near wharf. Had just come by rail to get it. Uncle M. there to say farewell. Ship rolled very steeply so boy of 10 fell off. More rolling...Around University, caught in rain. (Hose going when woke. Last night, many had asked after Uncle M.)"
"I didn't have any clean underwear so I was wearing a bathing suit. It was a one piece bathing suit from the 1950's, but when I had to go to the bathroom it was very inconvenient, as I had to get completely undressed. Then I found some men's boxer shorts. They were thick crispy cotton with pockets and racing stripes. I was wearing a fancy skirt for church and the blue boxer shorts were bunched up and sticking all out at the waist. I had been sitting in the desk at school biding my time; between getting undressed to go to the bathroom, pulling out my bunched up blue boxer shorts, and trying to think of answers to the questions on the test (that was) written on the blackboard. Questions were about Puerto Rico, apartheid,  and the U.S. government. I was lying on the floor next to a guy in the classroom. It was naptime. The guy was suppose to be my boyfriend because he sat behind me in school. He did NOT know the answers to the test questions on the black board, so he tried to look on my paper. The teacher down the hall was late getting there and when she did, the sign said, ""5B500."" We could hear the--all the students together in the classroom saying together, ""Hello Miss Johnson."" And she would say, ""Hello class."" ""Hello Miss Johnson."" ""Hello class,"" over and over. I did not have a place to sleep, so I had to sleep in the car, but I forgot to put on the emergency brake and it rolled backwards down the hill. I was in Charleston. At the College there were displays for Wonder Bread. Some bags were full and some had only 5 slices. I went to get some coffee at the snack bar and they told me they didn't sell coffee till after 10 a.m. I was asking people, ""Do you know my sister?"" I told them my sister had hired a doctor for the health services, and they said (that) they'd hired 13 new doctors since then. I kept searching for someone who had known Dora. Girls in ugly, HUGE, way too big shoes were sashaying down the sidewalk. One shoe with feathers was as big as a 10-speed bicycle and she had to move in angles to fit down the hall. That lady who crawled under the table on all fours was licking the floor with her tongue."
"I needed to submit my presentation in advance to someone. They posted it on a private web page where I could continue to work on it or finalize it. After it was posted on the web page all of the things that needed to be fixed or changed were highlighted in yellow. Some of the slides had multiple choice question and answers. I could highlight the correct answer, click on submit and it would accept it and then delete all of the others."
"I went across the street to a neighbor's house. She was lying on the couch and her apartment was a huge mess. She had a baby that was crawling on the floor with all the trash. I jerked her off the couch and punched her. I yelled at her, ""How can you treat your children like dirt? You don't even take care of them!"" I went and called Social Services. They came and took her kids."
"I forget to visit an old friend who lives by a lake. She is hurt that I forgot, but I say it was too stormy to come over.-- See an old DOOR, carved in wood, very elaborate; with a cross in a circle inscribed on it; I take the door off its hinges to see how it was made, and then put it together again; Later see a view of the sea....."
"Stephen's Mishap  I'm on a bus with a group of students. People seem to be throwing things out the window of the bus. My friend Stephen Ramos gets a fist-sized rock and throws it. It heads directly for the windshield of a car that a man is driving. The rock smashes through the windshield as the bus drives by the car, while the man is stopped at an intersection. The man quickly yells vengeance, records the license plate number of the bus. We hear him talk, recording the information, even though we're in our bus driving away. We're all shocked. I quickly move out of my seat to a different seat not so close to Stephen to seem like I didn't have a part in this event. Stephen assures us all he'll take full responsibility for his actions and put no blame on us."
"It was raining torrents this day and I was in my house, my condo in my living room when my sister called and I said ""Hi, how are you, what did you do today?"" she said ""Nothing, its been raining too hard"" and I said ""I know, I've been in bed all day today too, its just too awful out to do anything."
I went to lunch with a professor. We went to a deli and I ordered a #24. Then the next time I went to class he asked me to help him pass out some papers. Then he handed me a bag and winked at me. I looked inside the bag and it was a #24. I smiled; he remembered what I liked.
"I was sitting on a stool peeling potatoes - they were piled up all around me ... and I kept trying to finish them but I didn't even finish one. Finally I saw a policeman walk by, and, I tried to get to him but I couldn't get over the pile of potatoes - My mother and sister were walking with him - but they talked to me just as if I weren't stuck or in trouble. My pleas to get away from all the potatoes were ignored - I recall crying and I woke up with a dry throat and slightly coughing. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2. I felt mad that I couldn't finish those potatoes and frustrated when I couldn't climb out of them.3. An actual participant.4. Unpleasant.5. Of this I am not sure- I think it was out doors on a sidewalk or in the street.6. No7. I recall distinctly that all the potatoes were a bright green."
I dreamt I was at M-- B--. I dimly recall lying on the beach. Then I remember going out into the water. I just walked out into the water and kept walking on and on. The water came up to my shoulders but didn't get any deeper no matter how long and how far out I walked. That is all that I remember. Interpretation None Answers to questions 2. None3. Actual participant4. Neither5. Water-- M-- B--6. No7. No
I dreamt about going out with a guy only to find out that he wanted my high school classmate Jesse.  He got her and they watched a movie together.  My former friend Jenna and I 'rescued' her.
"I'm in a sort of back alley or somewhere dark and hidden, meeting up with some creatures that I've come here to work with - they are at war or have been attacked/conquered by some people, humans, and I'm helping them. These creatures are animals, little ones mostly, furry mostly, and nice guys. They have their own way of life and everything, they've done nothing to harm anybody, these humans are just bent on taking over and enslaving the little guys because they're little and they think the little guys aren't as good as them. [I don't know for sure if this is another planet but I sort of think it is.] The ones I'm meeting come, quietly, stealthy, and we talk about what to do. (I'm not alone, I think, there's another person with me - it may be Lori.) We go into the building we're next to - it's a sort of warehouse, and there are rows of storage shelving with things on them. It's dark except for occasional lights on the wall, meant as sort of night-lights or security, I guess - the whole place is dim and has a mysterious, suspense-drama look. The enemy is somewhere in here, they're coming this way, looking for the little people they know are in here. We spread out and get ready. Suddenly they're upon us, and a battle starts. Everybody's running around the stacks, people are yelling, it's chaotic, and bit by bit we retreat. [I don't know what kinds of weapons are being used, and I don't know if anyone's killed - don't think so.] The fighting lasts a while, but eventually everybody's out except me and my companion, we're staying behind to see what we can find out - we're going to pretend we're part of this group. They're pleased with themselves, thinking they've won again, and start setting up tables and equipment for a meal, they're going to celebrate. [Gradually the character of this scene changes. The ""military"" people become people I work with, the warehouse becomes the library, and the meal they're setting up becomes a catered dinner for the staff.] There's a table right in the middle where some people are already sitting, and I wonder if maybe I should sit there, or are they expecting somebody else they know? I hesitate, and don't want to draw too much attention to myself. This looks like the head table and maybe that's where I should be to hear the most, but I might be conspicuous. Then someone suggests that we can both sit together at this other table, the last one in the corner. Good, fine, we go there, sitting at the far end*. There's a lot of conversation, we're all having a pretty good time, but I'm getting hungry, we've been waiting for them to let us know the food's ready. At some point this table's developed walls around it, it's in a side room. Finally we decide it's been long enough, and venture out to see what's going on. By George, everybody else is eating! We'd better get started. First we come to a sort of appetizer bar where a blondish woman is serving dips and crackers. It's pretty depleted. I take a little plate and get a few crackers, dunking some of them into a white dip. Not very exciting, but a start I guess. (The server also looks bored and unaccommodating.) Nearby I can see a salad bar but I want some more substantial food, so I go on around this station (which is backed up to a wall of sorts - the whole place is sort of an open hall with partitions, and I couldn't see past the appetizers) to where there are tables for the rest of the food. But they're taking it away, most of the tables are cleared already! I'm horrified and furious. I go up and ask what the hell they're doing, we haven't eaten yet. This thing's not supposed to be over for another (20 min? 2 hrs? I'm not sure), either, they can't do this. Obviously there's not all that much left, anyway, but still, I'm hungry and I'm not going to sit still for this - I paid $7.95 for this meal and if I have to go out and get my own I damn well want my money back. The servers tell me the guy in charge has just gone down to the (lounge?), I'll have to talk to him. The others (from my table) are not as worked up about this as I am, but Lori and I go after him; I'm working up a fine rage."
"I'm doing visual research in the medium of cut paper and card, at a shopping centre - it's a pedestrian square of shops that's full of middle aged and old people - many of them tourists. My aunt Catherine worked in a Chinese restaurant in the square. She tells me to go and draw or take photographs of a troupe of Chinese dancers in the square. I watch as a group of uninspired men go through the motions of a tourist-orientated piece of choreography."
"I was performing an experiment. The experiment was very difficult and I did not entirely understand it. Finally after much practice I knew what I was doing. I pulled a string that was attached to a bird's beak. I was afraid I was going to hurt the bird and at first I did not want to perform the experiment. I saw that I was getting behind in my work so I finally tried the experiment. To my amazement, everything worked out all right."
"We left the meeting and as he locked the front door, I missed my brown handbag. ""Lucky you have a key."" He let me in and I went to the assembly room. In the front seats there was no bag. Then I remembered I had had to sit further back and going back found the bag. It was much fatter then usual."
"My dream started out on an island, a beautiful island with hundreds of green trees, a clean, fine-sanded, long beach (miles), and small cottages on a very sunny summer day. It was the perfect vacation spot. I was there with my mother, my twin sister, my old best friend, my aunt and my stepfather. It happened to be the day we were leaving the island to go back to the mainland and drive home. We drove our brand new white BMW car into the ferry, and took it across to the mainland. Upon arriving to the mainland there were thousands of people and hundreds of cars. It was like an amusement park at the ferry station. So, we decided to have the valet parking guy drive the car to a parking spot while we took a look around the place. The next thing I remember was looking for the car in a middle long parking lot, only to discover the car wasn't there. My mom sent my old best friend and I to look for the car. She and I found someone that worked there and asked him if there were any other parking lots. He sent us up this rope, climbing a mountain. Finally we reached another parking lot. We searched for the car. Then we saw these two teenage guys breaking into it. They were just about to climb inside when we confronted them that it was our car. They threw me in the back seat to sit with one of them and my best friend into the drivers' seat. They made her drive to the bigger parking lot. When we got there she jumped out of the car and ran to my parents, but she left the keys in the ignition. I can't begin to describe the anger I felt when I realized she did that. Before I realized what was happening, one of them was in the drivers' seat about to drive us away. I got so fearful I began hitting and punching his head. His friend tried to stop me but I threw him out of the car and then beat this guy in the drivers' seat to unconsciousness. My parents, sister, aunt and best friend came running and hugged me and thanked me. Then I woke up."
"I remember a dream where I was in a Victorian blue satin ball gown, trying to seduce an older man with white hair, who was resisting my advances. We were at a party of some kind and there were a lot of people flirting with each other. I remember the man and I were dancing together. Then we stopped. I attempted to verbally seduce him. He counterargued against my advances and stubbornly refused to give in. He looked rather like a brief flirtation I had at the Ren. Faire years ago. He wore a pale poet shirt and dark slacks. That's it."
"I was at school getting ready to go home for vacation. My sister, 17, who lives at home in Michigan was somehow at school in the dorm with me. We had our family car at school but we were going to take the bus to Detroit as I usually do when I go home and we were to drive from there. We raced around making plans, buying bus tickets and checking schedules. Then we went down to the bus station and checked our suitcases through. The only trouble was that we didn't know how to get the car from school to Detroit. All of a sudden I realized how silly we were and said we can drive all the way home. With relief we went down and claimed our baggage."
"I am playing hockey on a table which is pretty crowded with objects or food.  It seems that sometimes I am skating, other times I am just hitting the puck with my stick while sitting or standing by the table."

A tame lion was in a nearby building. A woman was hugging the lion.
"Jake is being very sweet and communicative. He tells me he sent my father a Valentine's card and letter because we don't appreciate him enough. He is curling my hair for me. He is painstakingly putting it up on tiny screws. Dwight is there somewhere, watching. I am trying to figure out how to talk to him about his upcoming divorce and reassure him that it's OK to talk about his feelings. He and I walk to a wall area, where we can talk alone, as he continues to put up my hair. I lean against the wall and think to myself, ""Maybe this isn't such a good time to talk about this; he'll get angry and maybe pull my hair."" Then he says, ""You saw me at the beginning of the thing. So I was upset, but I'm fine now. Everything is just fine."" I realize with a sinking heart, he's totally in denial. ""Fine?"" I ask incredulously. He reassures me emphatically, ""Everything is fine."" Then my father is in the room, walking with a small girl, maybe a cousin or grandchild. He is going toward the door to the next room and I look up and yell, ""Look out,"" just as the door pops off its hinges and crashes down on him. It's made of glass. The top half is a pretty etched and frosted glass and the bottom half is a regular window glass. It breaks, and he stands up, trying to hop out of the door frame. He steps into the bottom half and breaks it. He says he's OK and I yell, ""Check for cuts. Check for cuts."" He looks himself over and there seems to be no damage. The little girl had scurried for another room and I went in there to see if she's all right."
"A blond, young ordinary person is the winner of the writing contest. I am surprised at his good writing."
"Hunting for dominoes and filling their box. Then while we waited for our guests I went several times to the other door to see if they weren't ready. At last R was at the door and asked if we were ready. We told her we were and just waiting for them. She said Molly and Jo weren't coming and Kath was too tired. As I started to eat, I noticed I needed a saladfork and found someone had put forks around while I was gone."
"I can't actually see Mary, but I know she's alive and I know she's going to die sometime in the near future. I am in a bathroom, which has a large shower stall. I know that Mary has just finished using this stall. I am alone and thinking that I should go to Mary and hug her so that I can always have this memory of holding her close, after she's gone. There are other people in this large house and much activity, but I don't remember who the people are or what's going on."
"I was sitting in a room surrounded by many people. Everyone seemed very excited and were all talking rapidly among each other. I was apparently surprised to see some of the people there. A man was there by the door, but he didn't say anything and didn't stay very long. I recognized many of the people as close relatives to me and my family."
"I am in a large house with many rooms. I want to show off these rooms to someone and start to open a door to show two rooms off my bedroom. I see someone in a bed and remember that some of these rooms are rented. I feel embarrassed and shut the door. Now I and Ellie are ironing some dresses for the little girl, who is full of energy and hard to manage."
"Find myself downstairs for breakfast, thinking it is 8 a.m. and I'd slept over. It was only six so I returned to my room to dress, as I was clad only in nightgown and old robe."
"I am lying down in a car somewhere and three different people and a couple are trying to have sex with me. It is very unpleasant. There are no sexual feelings, just a sense of disgust and being used and forced. They get up and leave and one man is still there, and I say to him, ""I hope that doesn't happen again."""
"I dreamed I was at my own wedding (I am not married). I was conscious of the fact that although my mother (age 44), my father (age 47), and my sister (age 22) were quite nervous, I had an overwhelming feeling of contentment and happiness. As we walked down the aisle, which was down the center of an extremely large ballroom, the small orchestra was playing ""A1ways."" My groom (his face was not clear to me, and it was no one I know) was already at the altar and he was watching me intently. It took a long time for my parents and me to walk down the aisle; but all the while I returned my groom's gaze although I was aware that my parents were nodding to people in the audience and smiling at them. Suddenly, with my eyes still on my husband to be, I started to sing along with the orchestra. My mother was very startled and appeared to be a little embarrassed at my unconventiality, but my father quietly said to her, ""This is all hers."" My dream ends while I was still walking down the aisle and singing, and the whole audience, and my parents, were smiling and some of them were crying because of the great love my fiance and I had for each other. Interpretation In reality, I remember at by cousin's wedding she had the orchestra play this same song instead of the bridal march and it impresses me a great deal. My groom's and my staring at each other, I might interpret, as a strong desire to fall in love and be very much loved in return. Answers to questions 2. Contented, happy, calm, love3. Participant4. Pleasant5. A large room or ballroom with a bridal altar6. Yes. I have dreamed several times before that I was being married and that the orchestra was playing ""Always"" instead of the traditional bridal march.7. No."
"My mother is asking me if I was at an assembly of some sort, which had taken place at school. It was the ""Association of Witches"" or something like that. I had not been to that assembly, and I was very angry that she would think I was. I had seen my uncle and my cousin at a school assembly in a preceding dream that wasn't so sure, but I didn't think it was this ""Association of Witches"" meeting. I remember going to a vacation state, or somewhere like that. But I didn't really have to go very far. It's one of those dream things that's hard to understand. I recognize the state somehow. There is a high rock with plants (maybe palm trees) and water. There is plot missing in this dream, but I cannot remember enough to clearly depict it. I now remember receiving a card, a large birthday card (larger than the size of a book) from a male teacher at Center High School. I only know one teacher at CHS in reality, and she's a female. He sent me a card telling me something to the extent that he's happy with what I've managed to accomplish, and that some teachers just don't take their jobs as seriously as they should and those teachers should be fired."
"I'm at the Faire site, either midweek or after closing (though the sun's out) - everybody's gone and all the booths are empty. [It looks different, of course.] There are some SOCIETY FOR THE CREATIVE ANACHRONISM people around, doing their thing, still in costume. One of them has videotaped something during the day, I think a minor event of theirs, when there were plenty of people about - all of them were in costume, I notice - just like a real fair. I look around on the screen for myself, but I'm not in it. It's interesting to look at the same scene you're looking at right now, only with people, then without, then with, then without. They'd as soon I stayed and played with them, but I have to be on my way. I brought Tree with me and I have to fetch him. [I can't remember if he was in a carrier and got out, or had been out all along.] I keep calling ""Tree!"" and I'm getting worried. But now I do hear him, somewhere. I call some more and I think I hear him from under this vehicle here that's under an open shelter. Then I hear catfight noises, and I break it up only to find it's not Tree after all, but a big fluffy dark-gray-striped cat who's with a friend, worrying a koala bear, a small one. Well! The gray cat's pretty mad, but he knows not to mess with me, and takes off shortly. This still leaves me not knowing what to do with this koala bear, and I've got to find Tree."
"Then I had another dream that started, I was in a bathroom with some strange man, and this boa constrictor about 8 feet long, great big snake. And I was afraid of the man and the snake. There was a bathtub full of water and in the corner of the wall where the bathtub was, there was a little tiny ledge with a little tiny ladder on it. And I had climbed up on this ladder to get as far away from this snake and the man as I could. And they were both in the bathtub. And I didn't know what I could do to keep them from getting me. There was a shelf that I could reach, and it had this heavy little box on it that I threw down into the water, and this upset the man because apparently it had something very valuable in it. And the snake stood up on the end of its tail and tried to knock me off the perch, and I knew I was going to eventually have to come down. Finally I did come down, and I grabbed the snake when it tried to attack me. That was the only way I could get out of the bathroom. And I grabbed it right behind the neck. And I told the man, who seemed to not really be able to do anything to stop me, that I was going to kill the snake; the snake was sort of his brother. And so I pounded the snake's head on the floor until it, until I could hear the skull crack. And then I let go of it. And now it was a man, I believe, sort of crumbled up on the floor. I knew I had to leave. And this man, the real man, was quite wealthy. And I got quite a bit of money from him, and wet out to travel and get away. And I told him rather jokingly that I would meet him on top of the Eiffel Tower, because he was very afraid of heights, and I think this was one reason he hadn't tried to get me himself when I was on the ladder there. And the next thing that took place, I was in the Eiffel Tower, and I was coming down from the top in this sort of rickety elevator that you worked yourself. And I was a man, I believe; yeah, I was a man. And another man came up to me, and wondered if I would like to make a deal. This fabulously wealthy Arabian lady who was getting on in years wanted to pay for someone's young body, which she could take over. And she didn't care whether it was a man's or a woman's. She sort of thought it would be nice to switch to a man's body for a change. And so we talked about this, and then the whole thing sort of disintegrated into an entirely different type of story, about this young man and woman who loved each other and who were being persecuted by this older and very fat man who wanted the girl for himself, and who was this leader of this gang of criminals, against which this couple couldn't do anything. And this story went on for some time..."
"I'm in my wheelchair. A male instructor comes up to me and asks if I've been to the late evening sessions behind the stage. I say, ""Not yet but I've heard they are interesting."" He mentions one coming up, ""Issack"" or something. I say, ""O.K., great! I'll be there."" He leaves, all smiles. I'm sitting on the left hand corner in the back of an audience waiting for the show to start. Rosemary is behind me. She has 2 women friends with her. She's being very bossy. She'd see a situation and tell people what they need to do and where they need to sit, etc. I'm embarrassed. As the show starts, she moves away from me, like she's embarrassed for me. The show is set up like a three-ring circus. We applaud when they set up drums near our side. ""Oh good,"" I say, ""now I can see. I was worried."" I say, ""Oh! Are those the drums? They are huge!"" They're so big, the performers sit in them. Many performers come out, a huge black man, and a huge black woman with 6 breasts. The ""star,"" a young man with dark hair says, ""Now there's a woman! Hey, big mama!"" I am amazed. 2 older white guys sit down to sing an old folk tune. A woman sitting on my right sings with them. They sing very softly so they can assist her to sing. She's embarrassed and can't remember all the words. I'm a little envious. I'd like to sing too but I don't know the song. The performers throw gifts out to the audience. I catch a bunch of small Hershey bars. I pass them out to others, Rosemary, my ""daughter,"" and others. Then I catch some spearmint gum and pass them out, keeping one for myself. I've become the contact person in my area of the audience. I look in my purse and separate all my little presents into one section. I have necklace chains that have static electricity in them, little earrings, one shaped like false teeth, little costume jewelry pins, candy canes and some other stuff. A young black boy hands out an outfit for a 13 month old baby. I hold it up to my daughter. ""Will it fit?"" She says, ""I think it will."" I question it. I decide it doesn't and give it back to the boy. He says, ""Hang it on the Xmas tree and someone else will want it."" I feel like I'd like to keep it but that it wouldn't be fair to others. I think about having a garage sale and selling the things I don't want to keep."
"(06/26/00)[""Neal visits and I'm not prepared.""] I am preparing to do a presentation on dreams this weekend. Neal comes to visit. He arrives a day earlier than expected. I am not ready yet. I am trying to greet him, make the preparations for potluck and friends and get the presentation finished. A large group of my female friends come by. I am glad to see them. I need to ask some of them to help out. I look for one called Jennifer to help. As she is one of the more helpful ones. Neal sees a spill of dried food on the blue shag rug. He goes over to help clean it up. I am pleased he seems helpful. I want the presentation to be well done. I want Neal to enjoy the potluck party. He seems to be having a good time. We like each other."
"Last night I had two odd dreams. First I dreamt that my mother and I were going to take a boat out with Ms. Fletcher and her people, and have like a little parade through the channel. And we were at the park feeding pigeons at the pond and we got up and we went home and we went in the garage and we kind of, we had to climb up this ladder to get on the boat. And my mother started it up to make sure it had plenty of fuel, and we were just standing there watching it run, and I was kind of nervous. Then we shut it off and hitched it up to the car and driving down the street, and then before I knew it, we were in the parade. And I don't remember too much after that."
"Who The Fuck Are You?  I go to a card table selling tickets at an Armstrong High School Basketball game. A man at the table greets me as Mr. Hanson, and says he hasn't seen me in a while. I say to him, ""Who the fuck are you?"" He is offended. He is the father of an Armstrong basketball player. I shake his hand to make amends. My mom is there. I look into the gymnasium. The game is a rout: Armstrong is winning 25-2. It is the end of the first quarter. There is 1:02 left in the first quarter break. The team is warming up. My dad is out on the court with them. He is goofing off: tossing a ball between his legs and demonstrating a hook shot. There is a bridge-like walkway over the court about 30 feet high. I walk up and across it. The band members are playing on the walkway. My dad is talking with the players, making fun of them. I am very mad that my dad has been doing all this with the players. I yell at him and tell him that he's hurting the players. He does his goofy smile/grin and chuckles, not taking me seriously. I am very mad at him. I tell him, using the words ""big man"" and ""little man"", that whenever we converse and I want him to take me seriously, he doesn't. When he wants me to take him seriously, I do. ""Big man"" is the one who wants to be serious. ""Little man"" is the one who won't be serious. Coach Jackson Shooter comes up to me and says, ""Stop yelling at your dad and help Ben"". He is annoyed with my behavior, and thinks I am being selfish. He thinks I'm being selfish. I say to my dad again, ""You're hurting the players."" One of the players, Travis Kulik, is sick. A player who may be Andy Klien, but who has more facial hair, walks by. He does a handshake with my dad. Another player, Ryan Barnes, is there in street clothes."
"I had kind of a jumbled dream last night. I dreamt that my mother and I were in this boat and it was kind of rocking. And I don't remember too much about that. The next thing I knew I was in school and they were showing this movie about some girl -- I can't remember if it was Celine Dion, Pocahontas or Snow White, but it was kind of a combination of all three of those. And this guy next to me had a cell phone that was beeping, and the teacher told him to turn it off, and then it sounded making a back-up alarm sound and the teacher took it. And then I dreamt that I was in my room and I was listening to the song that was called ""The Prayer"" with Celine Dion and Andre Bocelli, except that Celine Dion's voice was like all chipmunky and really, really weird. I was doing something while that was happening, while that was playing, and my father walked in and he seemed to like the song still anyway, even though her voice was all funny and strange. And then I woke up."
"There was continuous flashing like heat lightning. I was at Al N.'s quarters. The place was dirty. Al was a car salesman. I looked out the window and I saw Grandpa Evans walking on his toes, coming to see me. Mary told me that the horse was not going to win. He was a sure favorite. I can't recall the name of the horse. I saw Franklin and some other historic personalities. Franklin said Carter said he would like to earn a lot of money quick and retire because he had to keep an eye on Denny. I wanted to dream what pp was going to win the 3rd race. I saw all the 1 p and there seemed to be more than one pp, like two or three ones. I thought of one and 1 pp seemed to come away from the other numbers and stood out by itself."
"I was with several others. We were going into a building where we worked. We had to walk on a narrow ledge several stories above the ground. The ledge overlooked a shaft that resembled an elevator shaft. I was worried about falling. We had to get to the door on the other side of the shaft. When I got inside, I saw that I was a half hour late. I felt that I should be excused because of the trouble I had to get into the building."
"At the Book Cafe: Father Andrew and Marissa Camden are tending the store until I can take over; then they go out the back door. Just then someone comes in who wants to talk with Father Andrew; I run out to see a blue Cadillac with a yellow ""C,"" for ""clergy"" on the license plate, turn the corner. I return to say that he has left and will be back Monday."
"I dreamed I was taking one of George Raff's tests in the histology lab at school (his subject, anatomy, has been over since January). I was writing the answers in a blue test booklet. There was one strange question that had two glass encased pictures with frames. One was filled with carbon dioxide and the other with air. The questions under these pictures were obscure. As I worked through the test I omitted one section which I returned to at the end of the exam. When I reviewed the question, I felt that I knew the answer, but I couldn't think because the class was making too much noise. I left the classroom and went into a room by myself that had one desk in it, and a lot of drapery covering the walls. I finished the test here and turned it in to Dr. Paff."
I am reading a special BIBLE attempting to learn how to exorcise evil spirits. Church service: I am in the Choir and study some new music. Talk to Father Andrew about it and wonder why we don't have that music in the liturgy?
"Tornado Five Hours Away  I'm at Grandma Redding's house in the upstairs bathroom trying to urinate. My sister Heather comes in the door and says there is a tornado 5 hours west of Langville. I figure that is about 1.5 hours from where we are now. My brother Wally goes into the room where my sister Ramona and I are sleeping. Ramona is still asleep. He looks out the windows, to check the weather. I think we should let Ramona sleep. I go out of the bathroom. Heather goes into the bathroom, saying she has to vomit. She is staying in my aunt Raquel's old bedroom. My brother Wally is staying in my uncle Danny Redding's room. I never get a chance to urinate."
"All the Sholes family members are at our house - SARA is sleeping in the attic; little Reynaldo is on the second floor; and Abe in bed in another room. All the rest of us want to go to a movie; we take a long time in giving instructions to STEVE (or Frank) who is staying home to baby sit. Finally SARA wakes up and says ""I can do it now."" Then both babies wake up and we get away late, or we decide to stay -- much confusion."
I was leaving an amusement park with my mother and sister. I was raining and my mother's fur coat got soaked. She said she would get my sister's coat.
"I am at the Guiding Dogs, where people get dogs, and I don't need a dog, but I see people I know there who are there to get dogs. But things have changed and many are not out there walking, they're not on a training trip, they're sitting around making calls, talking to their social workers and counselors and doing weird things and I am saying: ""you know, things aren't the same here, you should be out with your dog learning, you can't get to know your dog by sitting in a room, you should be out there practicing, that's the only way you're going to learn, by doing it. Why have you changed your training style because its not going to be as effective?"" I was very disappointed."
"Last night I had a scary dream. I dreamt that Jack and Polly were in town and I remember sitting out in the back yard Jack & Polly and me having a good time talking and drinking coffee. But when they came to town, somehow somebody found a way to bring all their equipment and their security system. And they wired our house ___with it_____?___. The one scene I can remember in this dream. Jack and Polly and I were going to go somewhere, or maybe it was Polly and me. And we were in the back yard and she said, ""When I tell you, you go out the gate, and once you've closed the gate, I'll go out the front door and I will meet you."" So she said something and I went out the gate and I closed it behind me and, of course, I knew she was turning on thesecurity system. But before I got too far away, these electronic voices said - ""Wait, you went out the gate. You did not close the gate."" And I turned around, and sure enough, the gate was wide open and I ran back there and I closed and latched it as best as I could. Then it happened again. I walked away and I got a little ways toward the alley, and I turned back and the gate was still wide open. And I ran back for a third time. I can't remember if I did it three or four times, but I started thinking. ""I am running out of time and I need to get away fast."" So I ran, and in this dream I could run, but sometimes I can't. And I was running and running until I got to the park. I didn't hear anything in this dream, butI knew what was coming and I was glad I could get away. And I had my purse and my phone, and a paper in my pocket with thei phone number, but I couldn't see too well and couldn't seem to make them out, so ____________________. I tried and tried to call them. I tried Information and couldn't get anywhere with that. And I was walking around aimlessly in the park feeling like a disgrace. I'm trying to think. I was first of all feeling afraid and second of all, feeling like a total idiot. I mean, why can't I do a simple thing like close the gate? And I feel like it was going to be a really bad thing for them_. And then the next thing I knew, Polly found me in the park, well, they both found me in the park. And I sat there and I put my arm around Uncle Jack's shoulders, and I said, ""I'm sooo sorry for making your alarm sound because I couldn't close the gate in time. And Polly's like, ""No, we're sorry."" And I don't remember exactly what happened then. I think we were all at a restaurant, and we were eating corn and apple sauce and then I woke up."
"Man, I had a bizarre dream last night. I dreamt that -- it wasn't really Halloween, but for some reason people were like dressing up and doing crazy stuff like that. And there were some kids from the neighborhood, big tall kids, dressed up as Ursula and for some reason the spell I remember that wasn't really in the movie was that Ursula had a seashell locket with a voice in it. She could cut somebody's foot and make them sing the song, and then she would draw their voice into the shell. And then here's the strangest part of all: Sheryl and Sandra and Sam were like touching me and beating me up in the bathtub, trying to get me to sing a Led Zeplin song I didn't even know. And Sam had a dog, like a Dalmatian, that would just go nuts every time somebody would enter into the room. Oh, and the person dressed up like Ursula who was trying to put spells on people, in my dream I took a lantern and I whacked and whacked and whacked the person's face with the lantern, thinking that I was going to get all the spell power out of Ursula. And Ladies and Gentlemen, I believe that is all for this tape. I'm not going to be able to put another thing on this tape, so that's it."
"(05/21/01)[""Poetry meeting costs too much.""] I am in a rec room or meeting room with a few people. We are the few remaining members of some club. Maybe a dream club or a poetry club. We are trying to figure out why we have so few members left. A man, like Bob van de Castle is there. A woman is seated on a couch. A board member, perhaps. She says she thinks the reason is that we've raised the club dues too high so the cost is prohibitive. People dropped out or lost interest. They decide to drop the fee level so people would be encouraged to come back. I ask Charla and her boyfriend to come read some poetry (dreams?) and then I am taking some trip down a hill ""back home"" to high school times. I also ask a woman poet if I can use one of her earlier poems to do something with. Maybe add a photograph or artistic expression to it. Maybe collaborate with her. She is hesitant. A good looking but aging man (dark Italian) comes up to ""me"" a beautiful woman in an evening dress and professes his life long love for me from many years past. He hugs me and still adores me."
"I hear about a road that suddenly caught on fire. Apparently some cars with steel belted radial tires worn down to the steel were on the road, and rust spots were on the road. It was oil soaked from years of use and it caught on fire. I ask where this is, thinking it is on a coast in some exotic locale. Oh, and it is snowing there a lot, but the snow won't put out the fire. It will burn for years. I hear it is in the state of Washington. I guess I'm hearing a radio reporter interview someone. He asks if the road is closed and now no one can travel there. The man replies, ""Yes, but we have the old road people can use."" The reporter says, ""But that one is windy and slow, right?"" I see huge clumps of land mass with gaps in-between like the road will be built to cross those coastal gaps. It will make for hard, slow traveling."
"(02/23/1996)$10,000 on Q-Bert  I'm at a gas station filling up my truck with gas. I don't have any money to pay, so I go home and get some, riding my old red Huffy bike back to the gas station. I pay for the gas and get a scratch lottery ticket with the extra dollar. It doesn't win. I get five more. None are winners. I get another, and it's a Q-Bert scratch ticket. I get five white Q-Berts with black glasses on and win $10,000. I wonder if that is my big winning. I think not, I am going to win more sometime. When I get out of the gas station, my truck is gone. The trailer part of the truck is by Curtis' house in Oak Valley. I have a man go get it, driving the cab of a semi."
"It was really early in the morning and my house was on snowy mountains. I was driving a conversion van and I went to pick up my two friends, one boy and one girl. I let the boy drive the van. It was really icy and snowy. He drove off the mountain. We were spinning and hitting trees when we finally stopped. We got out and I shrunk the van to where I could carry it up the hill. When we got back on the road, I dropped the boy off at my house and me and the girl went to school. I left school early and went back to my house. The boy was no longer there and I paged him and he called me back. He was at the neighbor's house. So I walked over there in a white t-shirt and pink underwear. When the door opened to let me in, I woke up."
"I was in some sort of medical center, as a mental patient.  Something was reminiscent of a long drive out of state.  I went to a nurse and asked about something, and there was some sort of 'treatment' that included putting a sort of sticker on the person's tongue, which she demonstrated to me.  I rambled to her about how I knew she was going to do that, because I'd dreamt it, but that it was weird that she did it because I don't have prophetic dreams, and so I must have actually seen her do that before in real life, but not remembered it.  Then I was in some sort of convenience store, and the owner was a little mentally ill, keeping her daughter locked in a cage beneath the counter.  I was going to try and help her escape.  Then there was a group of people being named for their new roles they had acquired for the next Lord of the Rings sequel.  They decided upon their new names and the reason.  My former friend Deanna was to be ""Styx"", the main villain.  She had a hole in her calf that was leaking green viscous liquid."
"A young woman is going away to get married. I'm going to sing at her wedding or graduation. I am wearing a wedding dress, lots of lace, and I'm well-shaped. I look fat, but I'm not. A nun comes up to me. We are introduced. She doesn't approve of me. I am making jokes about marriage, like a clown or a comic. I show the girl my silly undertrunks and laugh. She's very serious and doesn't laugh. It's time for the show. A small audience, 10 of us in lines, are on the stage. I'm second to left in front. The girl is to my left. I sing a story about a bride who broke part of her husband's tea set. She had to pay for it out of her own money. ""And,"" I told the audience, ""it has to be out of the principal, not the interest. I am serious,"" I say to a scoffing audience person. They don't like my message. A woman friend's daughter starts crying and has to leave the stage. Perhaps the message is too modern for her. It's like we're doing an opera with humor."
I was at home with one of my friends same age as me. She is my best friend. We were watching the rain come down and saw that the streets were flooding so we couldn't go to school. The only other person that appeared in my dream would be my mom wondering why we weren't going to school. We were happy since we couldn't go.
"I saw a crate of apples. They were large red ones. I picked one out and asked the fellow how much it was and he said 22 cents. I was walking down a stairway. When I got down, I noticed only had on my under shorts. I felt sort of embarrassed."
"There was a cat on the street and me and my friend picked it up and brought it home. It was very fat though. And one day the cat had two kittens, so we picked the kittens up and the cat and put them in my room and I held one kitten and then I put it with his mother and the other kitten and they fell asleep."
"I started out running some kind of errand for CAS on my way to work. I started out going across town as though I was going to visit Jennifer K. At some point though I headed downtown. I was at a place where there were two lanes in the street going each direction. There were a lot of parked cars along the sidewalk. In some places there wasn't enough room for another car to drive in the right lane, where I was. Yet, I somehow managed to get by without getting into an accident and without hitting any other vehicles and without being hit. There were a couple of times that I didn't know how I managed that. At one point there were a lot of big puddles of water in the street and another time it seemed as though it was piles of snow. Later it seemed that I was on a bicycle instead of in my car. At that point I was trying to figure out how to get to Jennifer K's from downtown. I was at an intersection. There were a number of men standing there. Some of them were smoking cigarettes. One of them asked another for directions. I wondered if I should ask the same man for directions to Jennifer K's. I hesitated and finally decided not to. Then I was riding my bike down this street. It seems that the other people were walking. I was having a really hard time getting traction on the snow and ice. I think someone behind me realized that I was struggling to get traction and so, and I'm not sure if it was a man or woman though I think it was a man, they pushed me until I was in a place where there street was clean and dry so I could get traction. I wanted to turn around and say thank you but I knew I wasn't good enough on a bike to be able to do that without stopping or losing my balance. I decided that I would have to just yell thank you and keep going but I don't recall actually doing that. I kept going and got to a point where I stopped again because I wasn't sure where I was. I thought that if I could get to 38th and Kessing well twice I was trying to figure out how to get to 38th street. I knew I could get to Jennifer K's from there. I was at 38th street but I didn't know the cross street so I still wasn't sure. I kept going and I finally got to a point where I thought I knew where I was. There were a couple of women or girls standing there. I asked them to clarify where I was. The one who answered me made it more confusing. I finally said, Yes, but if I go over this bridge then there's a McDonald's to the left and what used to be a T.J. Maxx store and there is a movie theater to the right. She looked at me oddly. She said, McDonald's yes. T.J. Maxx I don't remember ever being there. The movie theater, yes. I thought, Ah. I know where I am then. That's where the SFI store used to be. I didn't say anything else to her. I got back on my bike and headed back out. I was still lost. I ended up in this place where there were some people who worked for a candy company. They were delivering these boxes of candy to these different stores. I ended up by a very odd little store. It was as though it was located at the top of a ramp and it seemed to be kind of an open-air place. I don't remember there even being doors on it. It was a store full of snacks and candy and stuff. There was a box of this candy there. Someone came in and asked if they knew if this was supposed to be for them or for another store in their company. The man who was working said he had no idea. This candy was a combination of candy and ice cream packaged together. Like two separate things packaged separately and then together or attached together. I left there and ended up in this place where some women were working around a lot of boxes of furniture. They were involved in remodeling an office. They had twelve pieces of each of these different kinds of furniture. They all looked alike. Some woman came up and was talking about a round table that was there. She said she didn't want that in her office. The other women told her that every office was supposed to get it. She said, Yes. But I don't want it. They said, Okay. That's fine if you don't want it. I think they gave me directions too, because I think I was still lost. I got back on my bike and started out again. Then I ended up at a place where there were three men working. They might have been construction workers but I'm not sure. They were working on something where they were attaching pipes to each other or to something else. They had copper colored pipes. The things they were using to attach them were copper colored kind of rubbery pieces but yet they clamped them tight to hold the pipes together. One of them was explaining this to me and I said, Yeah, it's an okay job. I saw that it wasn't clamped tight enough in a couple of places and I kind of use my thumb to peal it back. I thought it wasn't going to work very well. He kind of laughed at me as though I didn't know what I was talking about. I just ignored it because it wasn't that big of a deal to me. I was actually there to ask them for directions and telling them where I was trying to go. They said, And you're on a bicycle? I said yes. They said, Why don't you let us do you a favor and take you there? I almost cried at that point because I was so frustrated and I really didn't want to be on my bike anymore and I didn't want to keep trying to find it and not being successful. I said, You would do that for me? He kind of looked at me like, Well, Yeah! Kind of like, why wouldn't I? Then this other man said, Excuse me. I got the impression that he was maybe the supervisor and it was up to him to make such a decision. I looked at him and he said, That's fine. We'll be happy to do that. I said thank you. I started talking to him. I really liked him. He seemed really nice. The other man seemed like the kind of man that comes on to every woman that crosses his path. The other man seemed like a genuinely nice man so I talked mostly to him. Then I thought, You know. I wonder if he would just take me home. I'm so tired and frustrated. Even when I talked to the women I almost cried because I was so frustrated. I realized that I would have to tell him where I live and they will probably say something like, You mean you got all the way over here from there on your bicycle? But I just thought how much I really wanted to go home. I was going to ask him if he could just take me home."
"I am sitting on a pasture-like land. I see a tiny kitten sitting ahead of me. A large dog and a cow are playing near her and I get concerned because she could get accidentally stepped on. The cow gets very close and I get concerned. The kitten finally gets up in the nick of time and comes over and crawls into my arms. I pet it and hold it, relieved it moved out of harm's way. Now I notice the cow is very close to me and I realize it's the same situation. Someone bigger than me is behind me watching like I was with the kitten. I get up, holding the kitten, and move up on a big rock where I am safer. The scenery around me is expansive and beautiful and peaceful. I turn around so my back is to the ocean side and see the pasture. It is also a pretty view, even though not as spectacular as the usual view."
"Dream is set in a seashore resort. Subject and subject's family are guests of a household at the resort. (The family of the household is unknown to subject.) The woman of the house is beautiful and desirable. She and subject meet on a side porch of the house. Subject takes physical liberties with willing hostess (fondling). Host passes and perceives action between subject and host's wife. Hostess remains calm; subject becomes terrified. Hostess remarks that she will have to get her other body and to meet her on the back porch. Hostess is still beautiful, but she has aged approximately 20 years. Subject proceeds to engage hostess in sexual intercourse. Due to the aging of the hostess the intercourse is unsatisfactory to subject, whereupon the subject replaces his pants and leaves. The subject now momentarily awakened and then resumed his night's sleep."
"Trout Fishing  I come to a stream where my friend Paul Jones is trout fishing. He gives me a rod and reel. I'm fishing with a white fly. The trout are all over the stream, and many bite at the fly. I'm using a fly rod. I set the hook on several fish but they easily spit the hook out. Some of these fish are large: two or three pounds! I land a small trout on the fly rod. We continue down the stream. I'm then using a spinning reel with a white fly. I catch another trout. We move with our flies as they float down the stream. There is a woman there. I think she wants to fish as well. There are three of us and only two rods. I don't want to give up my rod. The stream is the alley behind my home in Oak Valley. Down near my neighbors the Knife's house the stream turns into disconnected, muddy puddles that aren't good for fishing."
"Jack Thigpen's Doll  I'm driving my truck in a desert with nothing or no one around. My roommate Stephen Ramos may be with me. I see my friends Hank Anderson, Norman Noman, and another person walking on the side of the road. I honk the horn and pull into a picnic-like wooden shelter that is there. I shake hands with these guys; it's nice to see them. Hanks asks if he still owes me five dollars. I tell him no: forget about it. His mother drives up my friend Jack Thigpen in a station wagon. She is looking at a road map that has lines drawn around, or to, the Big Resort Area. Jack joins us. He has a tiny baby doll. He leaves it there when he goes away from where we are for a little while."
"I am at some big college-like school. Some of the women students have stolen a recently dead man's corpse and are playing with it, doing some silly witch-like rituals over it for fun. I and a woman friend are shocked to see this (in the gym). After they are done, the audience is leaving and so are we. I say to my friend, ""Come on, let's follow and see if we can retrieve the corpse and take it back where it belongs."" My friend is in agreement and is surprised I cared enough to do this. We figured the element of surprise will be with us, because we are so quick to go to where I am sure they are going to leave it, namely in the sorority lunch room activity center area. I search and search, in drawers, opening doors, etc. and finally find a box which it might be in. I pick it up and sneak off to find the male professor that it goes to. I go down the halls hoping to remember his name. I find a college of his and ask to talk to him. I begin to wonder just who I can trust here. [BL]"

"I was with my family in St. Joe. I was thinking that it would be fun for us to all go to a professional baseball game together. Not sit all in one row but several rows, one in front of the other, so we can talk together more. The next thing I know we are there. I'm not sure who all was there but it was at least my parents and my siblings and I. I wanted something to eat and drink but no one else was so I wouldn't say anything. I took some money, a ten-dollar bill, out of my wallet, folded it up and put it in my shoe. Someone said something about it. I said I forgot to do it earlier and I don't usually put it in my shoe but that was easiest right now. We were referring to the fact that you are supposed to put money, like a one-dollar bill, on your person all the time for luck. I think I actually got the money out because I was hungry. A bit letter I noticed others eating and drinking and I was aggravated because no one offered to have me go with them or offered to get me anything. Brian F was eating potato wedges and drinking a coke. Later I noticed others had gone and gotten things too. Still later Brian F was now eating a cheeseburger and drinking a coke. BJ asked if I wanted to get some ice cream and I said no, I really didn't want ice cream. What I really wanted was the potato wedges and a sprite. While we were watching the game I was almost hit a couple of times by fly balls. I also noticed that in between the sections of the stands there were these very tall, white, plastic, flexible holders that were taller than the stands and they each held a golf ball at the end. The golf ball could be released and thrown somewhere. It had some purpose for the game. I thought it was very unusual. I was walking around with Brian F and BJ and we were talking about people writing and talking about the end of the war. I was thinking that if I had initiated this conversation a year ago they would have dismissed me and not paid any attention. Now BJ had heard this from someone else and was very intrigued and ready to discuss it. I recognized that things seem to come around to their geographic areas a year or so later than here. Kind of like the time lapse between New York and California fashions hitting other parts of the country. Anyway, we were talking about this one series of books, I believe they were written about The Rapture. Two of the women I worked with last year were really into them but I didn't read them because they didn't sound like they coincided with my beliefs. Anyway, BJ was very intrigued by the whole idea and Brian F was just listening with interest and as though he wanted to learn and understand. typical for Brian F. I remember saying something about this books talking about the world opening up and swallowing people and fires etc. I reminded them that they are still written by men, as was the Bible, and as were Conversations with God, by Neale Donald Walsh. I went on to say that it is impossible for us to know these things for certain. That even though these people claim to be writing from God's inspiration, they are still human men and fallible. I went on to say that we each need to find our own truth. we left the ball game and went to another place. I don't know what the place was. It was a semi-circle theater. The round stage was completely dark except for a spotlight on the man speaking. The back half of the round stage had individual dark curtains. Each curtain had the name of a place in lights. One of them was Lesourdesville Lake Amusement Park. We chose that curtain. Immediately we were transported to another place. I thought it was going to be Lesourdesville Lake but it wasn't. This is difficult to describe. It looked as though we were watching a movie scanning the night skyline of a large city, but at the same time it felt as though we were there. not physically flying and not in an airplane. which is why it is difficult to describe that part. But now it is suddenly daytime and we fly past the World Trade Center towers and they are on fire and smoking. I realize where we are and when and I become very upset and fight back tears. we are on a boat and it begins to burn. It quickly docks and people begin to get off. No one is panicking and I get off safely. There was a coral colored carpet and I had to go up several steps to get off, but it was almost mazelike. I had to go up a step, walk to one side for a little while and find an opening to go up the next step. There was one woman in particular with long sandy-brown hair. I don't know who she is but we said something to each other as we were leaving. we are back in the theater. My family members are all in seats. I am approaching them with a notepad in hand. I see the Homers sitting there as well. Kenny H is sitting on the end of the row. I sit down on the floor next to him to ask him about this experience. I am thinking that I am sure that I am still dreaming. I asked Kenny about his experience. He said they did in fact go where their curtain said they were going. He said they were awake in coming to the theater and they were awake now. I was disappointed to hear that because I was so sure to that point that I was still dreaming. I was writing feverishly to get everything down on a notepad. Some people came up behind us and set up a table and sat down there. They seemed to be upper-class people. My paper was making noise as I turned the pages and they were getting very annoyed. I was having trouble finding a clean sheet of paper but did not want to stop for fear of losing some of this. Matthew came up to me. He is a much younger boy, maybe 9 or 10. I was trying to gather all of my things to go and sit with him. I had lots of papers, a drink, and a winter coat. I was having trouble getting it all. Matthew helped. As we were walking to our seats we passed Darren. He said that Matthew had said he would visit with Darren after this. I was aggravated by this and said I would have talk to Matthew about this and we would see. We went to our seats."
"(09/23/00)[""Mom and Patricia.""] I am visiting my mother. It is a large room in a mall. She is confused about what had happened to her. (hospitalization.) She is still weak. Others try to help her understand, but to no avail. I am looking through a file of papers and find a letter from Patricia responding to a question I had asked her. I am pleased she responded. She had found a grey pair of socks I asked about and sent me a pair, all balled up plus one more a darker shade of grey in case I wanted the darker shade. I look up to see that my mother is dressed in a pink suit and high heels (heals?) and leaving the room. She is in desperate search for something. I hurriedly put on high heels and join her to protect her. I take her arm and we walk side by side. She has trouble balancing in those shoes. I ask her questions trying to figure out what she's looking for. She mumbles and it doesn't make sense. Suddenly, we come to a steep staircase. We are at the top. It frightens my mother as her balance isn't good. She teeters on the edge, then turns and walks back to her room."
"I saw H___ A___ run out of a department store in A___ with his arms loaded down with oranges, pears, apples and grapes. He kept dropping fruit all over and he also dropped a toy truck that had a great number of little white blocks in it. The blocks fell out all over the floor and two clerks one a girl and the other a younger boy stopped to pick them up. The girl just stood and counted them while the boy put them in the truck. Among the blocks was a spool of thread. I was watching the proceedings and I was scared that they were going to discover the spool of thread. For some reason if they saw the thread H__ would be in some kind of danger. But the boy thought the spool was another block and put it in the truck. I was relieved and I walked away. Interpretation No interpretation Answers to questions 2. Anxious and then relieved.3. I was more or less an onlooker.4. Unpleasant5. No6. Yes. I could see the colors of the fruit, the white blocks and the white thread and I think the truck was red."
This is just a fragment of a long dream that I can't remember. A large rugged looking man lying sideways on a cot up on one elbow naked. A huge penis that looked more like a cow's milk sac folded over. A feeling he had just finished intercourse and/or a fight in which he was obviously proficient and the winner.
"Green Cords For $11  I'm clothes shopping at Ragstock with my mom. I buy three shirts and a pair of pants. One shirt is tight and brown. One is long sleep and striped; very nice looking. The pants are green corduroy and cost $11.00. Jeans cost too much. The chicken catching van is by the Uptown Mall. Norm from the television show Cheers is there with his wife. They almost rear-end us in the van. I'm at a loan place. The secretary calls me. She is physically attractive. Another man on the telephone has $10,000 in AT&T; phone bills."
I am with Theresa at a meeting. I have decided to take peyote. I swallow it and wait. I'm scared and excited to see if I'll throw up or die or what.
"I was at my friend's house, and it was nighttime. I was walking around outside trying to find something to drink and I found a bunch of pop machines, but all the pop was cold. I was really scared because it was a bad neighborhood and I was with one other person but I was still scared."
"I am in a huge Victorian house with other people. There are lots of kids. I am going down the halls and seeing groups of kids spilling out of the rooms and into the hallways. Now water is rushing in and I must run as fast as I can upstairs to the roof. I make it to the small windowed room at the very top. Now that room is like a space craft, NASA to be exact, hexagonal in shape, or the cone tip on the rocket. We must escape. I and some others are put into a suspended state, sort of like the beam-up thing in Star Trek. It disengages all our molecules, stores them and when we arrive at the new planet, which will support human life, we are reassembled. We travel hundreds of years and then I am reactivated. I guess earth was being destroyed and the smartest and best leaders, especially with good facilitating skills, were chosen to start the new home."
"Fragment: I was trying to pour liquid (tea or coffee) from a pot, but the spout seemed to be clogged, as the contents dripped out from margins of lid. It was some time before I came to the obvious conclusion that the spot was clogged, and investigation showed this to be the case."
"I strayed into a beautiful region under the northern slope of Mount Ida, shady ravines, clear brooks and cascades. How it all found room between Newtonville Avenue and the railroad, I did not trouble to explain. Walking east, I followed a stream which must have been a tributary of a larger one. Presently I saw a spring issuing from a cleft in the ledges, and at the same moment discovered that I had a companion for whom I wanted to get a drink of water. A large tin cup conveniently developed in my hand and I climbed ten or fifteen feet to fill it. But to my annoyance, the cup expanded to a bathtub containing lumps of black loam and enormous earth roundworms. While I was rinsing it out, I woke."
"There was someone who was trying to kill my daughter and this someone varied in age, I think, even in the dream, but they were always rather young. And it was a rather young girl and her age would vary anywhere from 2-1/2 up into her teens, and she was completely evil like the little girl in the Bad Seed. Not only was she evil, but she had some supernormal powers. She could predict things and make things happen which ordinary people couldn't do. At the beginning of the dream there had just been a terrific rainstorm in the place where we lived, which wasn't exactly here. As a matter of fact, it seemed to be in the mountains, although it didn't remotely resemble the cabin there that we have just been to. The rain had driven in under the door and it was on the floor, and I was trying to persuade my husband to hold our daughter on the bed and not to let her away from him because as long as we were with her, this thing couldn't happen. He thought I was sort of hysterical or nonsensical or something; I didn't know what I was saying and what I was saying wasn't very important, but I finally more or less had him persuaded and I went out and there was water on the floor in the bedroom and there was water on the floor in the kitchen. I was going to clean the kitchen up a little bit. Then some sequence happened and I was outside down below the house, and was going up to it, and there were quite a few people around it - all girls as I remember, and in their teens somewhere mostly. And they were around the house and some were going up towards it. There was a big screened porch and it seemed that this was sort of a community house or something. And so I was going up the stone steps toward the house and got on the porch there and then I believe that the little girl who was trying to kill my daughter for some reason was there and she was doing something ugly, and she was a rather little child now, 3 or 4 years old. And so I told her I didn't want her there. She hadn't particularly done anything wrong. I told her I didn't want her there and I started hitting her over the head with a coat hanger, and she started crying and screaming and the nurse that took care of her came outside on the screened porch. We were on the inside somewhere and she was telling the little girl that if she wasn't happy there, they would take her home. And so I picked up the little girl and was going to take her out to her nurse and tell her to never bring her back here again or let her come back here again, and the little girl bit the back of my hand. So I thought I could fix that easy enough, so I bit at her hand and I bit one of her fingers off, and it was so easy to do like biting thru wax or something. And I knew nobody's finger came off that easy and she didn't even seem to notice that I had done it. It didn't seem to bother her at all, and I just sort of spit her finger out or something on the floor and took the little girl out to her nurse. And by this time she was screaming like she had been very cruelly mistreated, and I guess she had since I had bitten he finger off. But it seemed to me that I was completely in the right and her mother had come up behind the nurse and they were both standing there, and I sort of tried to hide the fact that one of the little girl's fingers was gone because it wasn't bleeding or anything. But then I felt sort of embarrassed because I thought what if they got home and found out she didn't have any finger and that I had bitten it off and that was pretty bad. So I had better act like I'm sorry, even though I'm not. And so I told the nurse and mother how sorry I was that I had done this, and I went back and I found her finger and I handed it to her, to the mother, and told her if they could get her over to the emergency room quick enough that they probably would be able to sew it back on."
"I saw the horses walking around. I saw the 2nd horse and I said, ""I think he will win."" His number was 51. I went by the ticket window and I gave him a stub, check, or ticket and asked him if it was good. He said, ""Yes, if someone endorses it. Your daughter, son or friend."" I gave it to Carter and he was endorsing it. Then we went to one of the turns and there was a gate. It was closed and straight, there were posts like on a dead end road. I met Vance and his girlfriend. He introduced me to her. When she took my hand, she gave it a hard squeeze. There was a small tree on a wall by Carter. I pulled it out and off."
"I go to the bathroom. A young boy is playing nearby and drags his plastic toy through the urine. I tell his mother and then take it to the sink to clean it. As I do so, Lydia comes over. She looks horrified and says, ""Oh! There's a louse."" She sees two or three on the sink and my hand. She looks at me. I say, ""I don't have lice!"" She is suspicious of me. I walk out to the car. My ""man"" is there. We sit in the back seat together with some of Lydia's kids."
"There was a party.  My friend Deanna was naked.  She was going to open the door for her father and brother, and I thought about grabbing her breast."
"Last night I was dreaming that I had three classes to go to and that they were in the afternoon. The first one started at like 1:00, and why I keep dreaming about having to go to classes, don't ask me. I'm sick of dreaming that. But anyway, my first one started at 1:20 and it was like 1:16 and my mother was sitting at the dining table just writing and stuff like that, and I was telling her, ""You should go get the truck and bring it around. I'm going to be late for class."" And she said, ""No you won't; you'll be fine."" But it got to the point where I was shaking her by the shoulders and yelling and crying, telling her to get moving because I was going to be really late for class. And it was kind of hard because I was just screaming. And I can't remember, but I think it was like, ""Yeah, yeah, yeah,"" kind of blah. Then I was in this party room with these people and it was supposed to be something like a dance performance thing. It was going to be filmed on live TV and I was just kind of in the audience with the people. And it was a small room with a kind of a wooden floor, and it was, I think it was for the show ""Fame"" and I had the notion that ""Crispen"" won it last year--who the heck Crispen is, I don't know. And I was going in and out this room and going to the bathroom and few times, and then I came back and I was sitting around with people and they were talking about what they were going to do. And this one girl was doing some homework and needed to use bright (?) calculator, and it was really acting funny and we couldn't figure out why. And then suddenly I was, it was my father out at this little tiny building that I guess resembled the church that we had the party at, but it was more like a movable portable facility than that. And we had to go there for some kind of business, but I wasn't real keen on going in there because I had heard that their alarm system was real unreliable and could pretty much go off at any time when somebody so much as shook the place the wrong way. And so I stood back a few feet while they opened the door, and things were okay in there. And in my dream I really had to go to the bathroom, but I didn't want to because I was afraid that sitting down on the toilet and going would either make the alarm off or I would be lucky enough to be in there when, just happen to. So I didn't, I kept walking around for a little bit, doing different things, getting stuff ready for some kind of event. And I finally went to the bathroom, and then I woke up, and I had to go when I woke up."
"Stephen's Ill Logic  I am with my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson. I confront Stephen with his own inconsistencies, self-contradictions, and his ill logic. He largely ignores me, downplaying its importance. I have had enough of his crap, and I leave, frustrated and agitated."
I was driving a car through a hilly countryside and there were two small children sitting in the back seat and looking at the scenery and laughing. I stopped the car and we all got out and I picked up a small rifle and went looking for some animals. A big tiger came charging through the brush and tried to attack the children. I picked up my rifle and shot it through the head. The children looked at me with admiration and I felt happy. It was a bright sunny day and through the trees I saw two deer drinking from a pond. I shot both deer and loaded them on the car and then the children got out and I gave them each a deer. As I drove off the children threw kisses and I was happy and excited.
I go to an analyst who look like Dr. Smith and who asks me for a long-term commitment. I say OK I am overwhelmed that he wants to pay me! But I also made another appointment and have a time conflict; undecided what to do; overcommitted.
I dreamt I was in a sports field and that I was the one who made the most points. I wanted everyone to applaud me and there was a huge celebration in my honor after the game.
"I was in something like a basement storage area.  I heard my wife Bonita voice from above my head-just faintly.  I looked up and saw her atop a storage bin, about 20 feet high, and my daughter Christina dropping toward me, headfirst.  I caught her by the shoulders, and she seemed to be all right -- except maybe for a stiff neck -- she smiled, anyway.  I was furious with Bonita and bawled her out for dropping Christina, especially before even having made that halfhearted attempt to get my attention."

"I am trying to put on a glove; it has the fingers removed, which makes it easier, but it is still a struggle. It is pink and goes all the way up my arm to the shoulder. I see my white blouse underneath it. There is only one glove for the left hand. I feel great happiness at being able to finally get it over my bent fingers and the bandage I wear on my wrist. Another woman wears a black lacy glove."
"I get in a small row boat and go out to sea to climb aboard a yacht. My hands have a hard time getting up the hand holds and I nearly give up and fall into the sea, but I persist and get on board. I'm a stowaway bound for Europe. I hide in a cabinet and listen in to conversations. Finally I have enough information I can blackmail the captain so he won't toss me over board and I get a free ride to Europe. He likes me, but does power play games with me like putting another woman seated between him and me and watching my reaction. I smile. I know I have him."
"I have a small part in a play. Ginny plays the mother; I play the young daughter. We rehearse it. I talk to others about the fact that I have this part. I feel some sense of consequence because I have a part. Opening night comes. Ginny can't make it. I get there and realize that I have not attended one rehearsal. Now I'm embarrassed and guilty. I don't know when I come on, or my stage blocking. I go into the women's room, which is a dressing room. Men and women are there. I have to go to the bathroom. I'm embarrassed. I sit on a toilet with no covering stall. Desmond is putting on make up and he looks over at me. I feel embarrassed because my bare butt is showing. He speaks to me. I say, ""I need to find the director."" The play starts. Ethan is in the audience already. I see a man who is like a stage manager. I go to him and tell him who I am. He comes with me to another room down the hall to hear me do the part. I start to sing. He's interested in the voice quality, but I forget the words. I make excuses. I say, ""I can't think why I didn't attend any rehearsals, oh I know, I was sick. I had a cold for a week and a half."" I laughed nervously knowing there is no excuse to miss rehearsal. I'm amazed he's still considering me to go on. Ginny shows up. She's late and disorganized and not ready. The man says, ""Practice and we'll see."""
"I'm on my way somewhere, driving a car with a female passenger - she's not a friend, and I'm thinking she's not comfortable with my driving - this road has a lot of curves and the lanes aren't marked (there's no paving, though it's good and solid, and smooth - and it's through town, sorta like Oak town), and possibly I'm too close to the wall sometimes - there's a wall median divider, and we're driving on the left of it. I'm just waiting for her to bitch about it, but trying to stay out so she won't get nervous. I'm also looking around at the cute little houses that line the road, and thinking it would be nice to live in one of them - there's a grocery store right down the street, very convenient, there are lots of nice things about it - but it is a very busy street, hmm, why would I be thinking about that anyway? Not my kind of place... Later, I'm at a going-away party for a fellow employee, in a restaurant-bar. It's fairly dark, and there aren't many people I know here, and I don't feel like mingling much. I'm sitting at the bar looking at a magazine. There's an article in series about this young man who's had a number of turns in his life. The first piece is headed, ""Jail 1"", and chronicles what led up to him doing something that he went to prison for and how that affected him. The text goes down the left half of the page, picture on the right. He's nice-looking, dark hair, sort of a country-boy type, but apparently a very nice guy who made a few mistakes. The next piece, ""Jail 2"", comes after another article or 2, and tells the next story, and then the 3rd piece tells about him having a sex change. There are pictures here, too, but also there's a TV nearby - must be up behind the bar because I'm looking up - and there's her, and her girlfriend on TV, probably videotape. There's a closeup, and you can see it's him and all, and I'm thinking he doesn't make a very good-looking woman. Oh, well. There's a woman sitting next to me, middleaged, she's looking over my shoulder and making the occasional lame remark like, ""Why would anybody do such a thing?"" I decide it's time to mosey on off, and take a few steps toward the door, when I'm grabbed by this cheerful young woman with somebody else in tow, she says, ""How are you? You really look good, come with me"", dah dah dah. I think she must be somewhat drunk, as a number of people are getting. She grabs my waist and tugs me over to a seated group and proceeds to chat with them too - ""Look who I found!"" - the thing is, I don't know these people. I think she doesn't realize that, and the others must assume she does. Oh my. I'm trying to think of a way to extricate myself."
"A White and Black Snake  I'm with my mom, other family members, and people from a different family. I see a snake come out of a rock-like area where a sleeping bag is. I point it out. People are frightened. I grab my camera and run to try to get a photograph of it. It's about 30 feet long, white and black in color, and really thick. I follow it and take a photograph. Several people are carrying the snake, a couple meters apart. I take a photograph of them carrying it. The group I'm with is going to my friend Hank Anderson's grandpa's cabin. We're in Fishville now; my mom has driven this far. It's getting dark. I'm full of energy and want to go. I say I'll drive. Another family is in a vehicle following us. We leave a park-like area after adjusting the loads and the passengers in the vehicles. Initially I have trouble driving: I can't find the brake pedal. I'm not used to driving in the United States. I say it's less than an hour to get there, and I try to remember the exact route to take."
"Writing Time  I'm with my housemate Norman Noman, his girlfriend Sunny Pile, and my dad. We seem to be near Golden Acres or Goldenshire Golf Course in Oak Valley. My dad gives us four of five pages of white paper to write on for a half hour while he is gone. I'm excited to do this. Norman has taken a lot of coins from my green ceramic change jar to buy alcohol. Something happens with Sunny and her friend. I may do something with them. I don't use the time for writing, but I have a good time."
I had been locked in somewhere and I was released. I went in a secluded place and urinated. I was interrupted a few times by passersby.
"At a dinner party: steak and potatoes. Wendy observed that potatoes are cool, if stuck on side of oven, but hot on rack. One of the fellows picks me up and carries me around, and then puts me down. lots of fun and people. As I look up I see this alignments of 3 moons.:"
"A tall good-looking man enters. He has come with a bus load of kids. They have all been saving their food and money to afford this escape to where I am. They have heard of how well I did and want to do the same. I quietly stand in front of him, facing him. It feels good and calm. I like him. He likes me. He is different from the others. (He looks like the conductor I met at the coast, Tony Amour.) The welfare people need my report and because I was honest, they have to take away a couch in my parent's home. I have a small girl with me."
The little girl was showing a colored Christmas picture and talking about it to her mother. I thought she might like to see my book of religious pictures and went to the bookcase to look for it but first picked out three or four photo albums and one of them of snaps I didn't recognize I decided to throw away.
"A man is trying to mount a horse. He says he likes thoroughbreds because they fight (or are strong). The horse becomes a black, long hair Persian cat. I am walking and I ask where the sheriff is. He is the actor John Ritter, very cute. He comes over to me and we talk. I am very attracted to him. We stand close together and I am very aware of his warm, caring eyes. I put my arms around him and we hug. We don't want to be separated. It is very caring and good. Sensual. He tells me he has 2 kids. The girl is moving up to the next step in her studies. She's quite smart and is advancing fast."
"Running In A Corn Field  I'm in cornfield running with the Brimson men's basketball team. I, or we, are looking for a person on the team. It may be Jordan Mallstrom, or it may be a shorter, fatter guy. The coach Yar Glenn is then giving the team a speech, telling them to not listen to the new woman who is helping coach the team. He says to listen to him. I am playing basketball with my friends Jimmy Youngman and Sam Crimson on a big mat, the kind used for the high jump. I pretend to play well. I think that four players out of some five players must be on the New York Knicks team."
"I am driving back from a town near my hometown thinking I need to slow down so as to not hit someone. I slow and two boys, one big and one small, appear in the road. I barely miss them and keep going. I am next at work and the local funeral directors bring in a body in parts. I think it is Oprah Winfry but it looks like a white mannequin. Someone says they wouldn't fix it because it was a ""skull hanging"". A man I work with has to fix it and it smells bad. I may have to do the makeup. I know I am sleeping but I can't wake up. I think my son is in the house and he comes to the bedroom and I manage to say help me wake up and he does, but he isn't really there. That was a dream too."
"I was in a big home. I was ours. I saw it being repaired. I looked down the street and elephants were coming up the street. People walked and paid no heed to them. Then all at once one of them started to run fast up Broadway Ave. and about three of them were coming up towards us. Then all at once the three elephants started to run up towards us and the people ran alongside of the elephants and they ran by us. A car stopped beside our home. I heard a voice of a man loud talking to a young girl in the car. Then the two men were colored and the girl was white. She opened the door and went outside and walked away. I looked at our bathroom. We had about four or five toilets. I looked under the walls to see if there was someone there because the water was flushed. I saw a young lady's legs standing in one of the booths, so I walked out of the room. I was cleaning a big wooden dish and a fellow beside me started to cry. When he stopped, I started to cry."
"I seemed to have my head covered with a big piece of tape and I wanted to get out, but the tape was holding me down and I could hardly breathe. On two occasions this was done."
"I saw Ehnce to Now Hear This in the entries. I seemed to be above the earth and saw an atomic explosion. Then I was back down on the earth driving a car on a highway. I was driving at a fair rate of speed, but some of the drivers were passing me at a high rate of speed. I seemed to be standing at their speed. I was wheel-barrowing some items and Bill Grove gave me a hand when I got sort of stalled."
"At last the service came to an end. I could hear the singing of two stanzas of well-known closing hymn but then the other two stanzas were mixed in one and I couldn't tell which words were being sung. We closed with the Mizpah benediction. Now I walked down to meet my Hayes cousin's son, introducing myself by name. I said he would not remember me well. He said, ""No, I was such a tiny tot when you visited us."" Then I saw a little 5-year-old girl in a blue dress and asked, ""Is it your daughter?"" ""Yes."" Then we talked about why we had come to the islands. He said he had to be careful about stairs. I asked how he had managed the big flight of stairs to the entrance. The elevator came down to the basement which could be entered by a side door. We talked about elevators. Then I pointed to the house across the street and said, ""That is where I live."""
"Well, the first part I remember, we had to do this weird thing. This guy put a board across this big muddy spot and we had to go down it. But then when we got there, there was nowhere to go. When I looked to my LEFT I saw the inside of my house. I don't remember what was on the right. When I got up from the spot I was in, I walked into the big room and Courtlyn asked me if I wanted to have the other shirt and shorts that Holly gave her. See, Holly gave her two matching shirts and shorts for two of us to wear to the Valentine's Day dance. Setting: The dream took place mainly in this big room. I don't know, it might have been in my house. Characters: The weird guy with the board I didn't know. Courtlyn is my good friend, and Holly is a 7th grader at my school. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, confused. Well, when I went down the board and saw the inside of my house, I was confused and a little angry at the guy. Other than that I was happy."
"I first dreamed that I was in Florence, because that is where my parents were getting married (weird). Either I was really sick or sad, because someone gave me a huge cake. I remember falling asleep in my dream and being awoken to crashing noises and explosions. I looked out my window, and people were running and screaming everywhere. It was weird though; they were all celebrating for something, rather than screaming about something bad. I was frustrated because I couldn't find anyone I knew and I had no idea what everyone was screaming about. Then I must have begun a new dream because all of a sudden I was at the spring carnival. Everyone was having a lot of fun as usual --Jello-wrestling, slip-and-sliding, and everything else --I can't remember a lot of details, but then everyone went to the dining hall. I was eating strawberries with sugar. Across the dining hall, Leah was strutting around on a table. She got embarrassed and tried to make it a joke, but no one laughed. Then I woke up."
"Lucid Basketball Warm-up  I'm on a basketball court with a team warming up for a game. I take long, strong strides. I run around the court by myself. The other team is warming up as well. I take off my outermost layer of clothing, and still have on a warm up top and a jersey. I feel smooth, strong, and confident: like I am a good player and I know it. At some point, I realize that I'm dreaming."
"I had a run-in with this guy I dated very briefly. I had a bad sexual experience with him a few months ago and was upset that I was seeing him again. But when I saw him, he was cuter. We talked about the relationship and decided to have sex again. The sex was a lot better the second time. He was bigger and lasted longer, knew how to move. I kept wondering why he was so much better. We had great sex. I wanted to see him again. After he left, I thought, ""Even if I don't see him again, the sex was great."""
"I was on Brattle Street, which seemed quite deserted, thought it was daylight. I was walking slowly by the closed doors of the buildings opposite M's. Suddenly I heard a series of rapping noises, which seemed to come from within. I was impelled to open the nearest door, and saw before me a bare entryway in half darkness, with a flight of uncarpeted stairs leading to the floor above. Looking up, I beheld with chilling horror a simple walking stick standing on end on an upper stair, and while I gazed, saw it rise, move forward and descend with a sharp tap on the next step below, precisely as if in the hand of an invisible person! I thought that I fell to the floor overcome with terror. Then, of course, I awoke."
"A fragmented dream. My spine was broken and had to be reconstructed. Apparently the trick was to mix a very smooth gradient of colored paste, and infill between the ribs or spinal columns carefully, to look continuous. The rest of the dream involved pain, and something relentless and stressful."
"I just bought an old run-down house in a poor neighborhood. I want to use it to showcase local talent. But I want the help of the neighbors to fix it up nice, so I invite them to come see two very talented little girls, one a one-year-old and the other 2 or 3 years old. They are shy, but when they get started dancing and singing, they are very good! The audience is in one of the rooms, no furniture, the wall paper is peeling. They really like the girls."
"I dreamed that three other girls and myself were being held in this large building by a gangster. He had much equipment for his gang, guns, lens, etc., and we kept destroying them. He became very angry, but did not kill us. He could not let us go because we knew so much. I managed to find a way to escape and the four of us looked for a place to hide. We came to Clarence Brown's furniture store. I thought this would be an excellent place since one of the girls last names is Brown. They were having a large party at the store and we had to tell just whom we came to see. I told the girl at the desk I wanted to see Clarence Brown and she replied he's been dead since 1863. She immediately knew we did not belong at the party and the gang leader's men--all over the party began to chase us down the street. We found an old house where we stayed for a while. One of the girls became engaged. We were very happy for her, but it seemed to mean that we could stay there no longer, so the other three of us set off again to look for a place to stay."
"I was at a big meeting of Catholics in a huge house in the country, and I didn't want to talk to so many people so I shut myself in a bedroom and took a nap. Then it seemed that people had been asking me for money for one thing and another until I had none left--I was mad about that. I went downstairs and on the way to the stairs I remember seeing a woman at a switchboard and a man on an elevator. When I got to the bottom of the stairs there were so many people there and when I saw my husband coming down the stairs, I decided to play games with him and hide. But he went home without me, and I started walking home on the country road in the dark. Finally, someone in a coach pulled by horses picked me up and it was raining. Then I woke up. Interpretation I interpret the idea of the Catholics taking my money as originating from my hearing older people talk of how much money the Catholic Church asks its members to give. Otherwise, I don't understand the dream, except that I often don't feel like mixing and talking with a lot of people. Answers to questions 2. Tired, Angry, curious (about the nooks & crannies in the big house).3. actual participant4. neither5. A huge house in the country.6. No7. No"
"Bicycling Hills  I am riding a bicycle up and down big rolling hills. I slow down at the top of the hills and speed up at the bottom. There is a bicycle in front of me. I get close to it at times, and then slow down. There are people on the bicycle with me. The bicycle in front of me goes off the road. There are two bicycle jumps on the road: one smooth and one rigid. I want to go on the smooth route. A pool of water will be under the jump to land in."
"I'm in a line with my daughter Paulina. Then, I am the playwrighting class teacher, helping Jock teach the class. I've read the contest play entries and come into the classroom. No one is there. Jock is sick and the students haven't come in yet. I see Richard and we talk. I am attracted to him and he is sort of to me. I am aware he's younger. Now there is a bed in the room and I sit on it and Richard flirts and we hold hands and roll around playfully. There is some witty repartee as we ""dance"" with a push-pull feeling - like him or not like him, that is the question. My brother Dwight comes in and I try to introduce him to Richard and three other students that had come in late. I can't remember his name and call him Jackie and he corrects me and says Johnny. He's a bit annoyed with me. He gives me two cans of soda and his business card. I see on the card he makes wood toys and a woman says, ""Oh, do you carve them with his knife or your dick?"" He's leaving and retorts, ""You tell me, girl."" He's out the door and I wisecrack, ""What a cutting remark,"" and laugh. He laughs and is gone. I feel a little badly that my sarcasm could be taken hurtfully (a cutting remark). A student named Nate wasn't going to be in today because his wife or girlfriend was knifed, but he shows up. I want to ask him how his girlfriend is doing, but so much is happening all at once."
"I was in church, at mass and suddenly the father stopped the mass and said ""that's all I'm going to do, I'm not going to do anymore mass, I'm leaving"" and he did and we all got really mad, all of us in the church and we started to say ""he can't do this! We have to have mass. What would happen if all the priests did that? We'd have no more mass! It would be awful."" My friend B and her mother and I were walking out and I said ""you know, that's terrible, I think he just did that because he's got somewhere to go on his schedule and he just wanted to get out and do it"" and B's mother said; ""he's right there. He just heard everything you said"" and I said ""I don't care! I'm glad he heard me and I'd say it again if he wanted me to because its not fair that he did that to us."" And I was real mad and didn't know what to do. We kept walking and went home and I was at the church that was across the street from the house where my parents lived when I was growing up, so we went to their house."
"Since this concerns my grandfather, and the last one about him was rather impressive, I jot this down right after arising. I and assorted others are in a corral. Many of us are whipping ropes around or helping others whip some around. The object is to catch and tame the camels (2-humped kind) corralled there. My grandfather is there. He is an old and apparently rather famous man, for people are concerned that he will overexert himself, or hurt himself. Many try to help him, as I do, and it is considered something of a privilege. He catches a camel, exercises it or something, and finally gets it to kneel down while he cleans it and rubs it down. This seems to be most of the taming job. Then he lies down to rest in a large, coffin-shaped box which is actually a hi-fi equipment cabinet. I am concerned about his dying, for he had exerted himself so much for his age. I am fooling around with a hasp that locks the box, as well as wondering if it could be used as a coffin if he died. I tell him to holler when he is through resting and wants out. He dies and does not answer. I open the box and see he has finally died, finally achieved his rest after a long, active, worthwhile life. He has apparently died only a minute ago and I wonder if I should try to revive him, but realize that it probably wouldn't work, and he deserves this final rest so much that it would be cruel. I tell my mother he is dead. I am quite unhappy, and crying. She wants me to call the undertaker. The coffin is being taken away on a train. The camel he tamed walks after the departing train, and I and the family (mother + unidentified people) walk alongside. It is a strange sight, and onlookers think it's not Christian. ... Then I and the family are in a compartment on the train going to wherever the final burial will be. The coffin is in the compartment with us. One of the members of the family is a teenage girl, the daughter (?), and she wants to get off for a while in NYC, but we won't let her. We remind her that grandfather (or was it me?) had said that NYC was to the country as the genitals were to the body ... the train was traveling north."
"Disrespecting Rachel Steiner  I'm at a restaurant where my friend Nate Nelling is working as a cook. I see my friend Marge Drummond in a booth, and go sit with her. My friend Emily Zates is there, having a gin and tonic. I had a bloody nose earlier in the day and there is crusty dry toilet paper in the inside of my nose from this. My friend Mya Rousing is there. She may see the toilet paper. I eat a mushy onion and pepper-covered tortilla. I'm going into a place that is Grocery Getto, though it looks like a church. I see a man who appears to be the assistant manager of the store, Mike Johnson. He is on a four-wheeler. I think of writing a dream pamphlet for this church-like place. I walk into the building. Nothing is happening upstairs. I go downstairs, where I find my brother Wally watching a movie with my classmate Rachel Steiner, on the couch. When I see them I don't want to be there. I make the conversation terse, and say I'm tired, and leave. I disrespect Rachel. I don't want to see or talk to her."
"I was walking with mother and R. I was to have a tumor cut from my head. I felt the knife. It was cut out. I asked what the biopsy showed. No cancer, just a few little cancerous grains. I was puzzled. (Woke up with sharp neuralgic pains in my head.)"
"I was chasing two boys who Bob went along with. They ran thru a field and I ran after them. I jumped over one fence and then another one. There was tall weed or grass. I looked for them in it. I finally found one of them and he told me where the others were. So we all went back and made an agreement and settled the trouble. Later I saw Harold Hilts. He had about five or six diamond rings. He put out his hand and had them on his fingers. I was with Audrey. I looked down and saw a quarter and a nickel. She saw it the same time. I was going to pick up the quarter, but I let Audrey take it and I picked up the nickel. We walked on and I saw a nickel in a hole. I picked it up and looked into a smaller hole and I saw what looked like a quarter. I took a close look and it was a bottle cap. As I was getting up, two of the boys I made an agreement with came upon me and accused me of taking something out of a pan. I saw when I looked at the bottle cap but I didn't bother it. I saw now hurry and look into your hidden item and see if I touched it. We came upon two hunters. A duck took off across the field running in flight. The hunter took aim, but didn't shoot. He thought it was a pheasant. Then there was a flock of ducks or pheasants in flight overhead. He shot at them, but missed. Then I saw a big duck flying by. He didn't shoot at it. Then to our surprise we saw a green tentacle. It was very big. He shot it and missed. He shot, then I held his gun at a hand it held out and missed. Then we saw the monster face. It was big and red. He was taller than the trees and was moving our way. Then there was a mist like in front of him and he couldn't see us. We started to run. We ran fast and then downhill and finally got away from him."
"I was out on the playground and I found a cricket and I kept it and it had a little baby and then we went on a boat ride, a submarine, and we had animals in it, like it was a veterinarian care center and then the submarine started to shake and I said what's happening. The cricket was inside my lunch pail and then the veterinarian started to collect the medicine because she thought the submarine was going to explode and I helped the animals not to be afraid because the cages were shaking. In a bottle there was a little baby pelican."
"While looking over a large scrapbook, I see two cancellations which I say I want because I collect them and I proceed to detach them. One is ""occupation"" and the other star-shaped says, ""victory."" Both are in clear black letters on manila paper."
I was making changes to a website. I kept submitting letters and something else to get quotes on how much the changes were cost. I kept making changes and sending it back for more quotes.
"I had a dream that I'd called Saul. His answering machine said, ""Hello, Barb...I love you."""
"I was standing by the window in the living room looking down on the berry bushes, and suddenly acquired binocular telescopic vision. I zoomed into this big black spot I saw, and saw that it was a spider. But not a normal spider, NOOOOOOO. This spider was huge, first off. Maybe a foot across. Second, instead of having a globe shaped abdomen like normal spiders, it had a giant rectangular box. This disgusting thing was almost enough to wake me up. I drifted halfway up out of the dream (long enough to register the spider as a dream) and sank back down into it. Now a bee was crawling around in my right shoe. I was wearing my black boots, and the plastic toe shield had fallen off. I thought to myself, ""Well, as long as I don't antagonize the bee, it'll be okay."" I talk with my brother for a bit, and soon he asked me why I wasn't worried about the bee. I explained why, but no sooner had I finished, but the bee started stinging me over and over again on my fourth toe. I contracted my foot, to pull he tail off the bee, but I only succeeded in pulling the bee into my shoe. OH NO! Then I woke up."
I was shaking hands with someone. I went to confession. Then I went again and we walked by twos up steps to the priest who was sitting at the top of the steps.
"I watch as two fluffy white dogs which are somehow magical need to fly up into the sky. Get above the turbulence layer of air to bring back fresh pure air. One dog blows air into the butt of the other dog. They fly up, inflated. I am now up there with them helping get past the turbulence layer. We successfully get above it and gather fresh air. I return to earth. Then I am holding a pistol which doesn't fit right in its holster. I struggle with it until it slips in and fits correctly. Now the pistol is purple and slides in and out very easily and comfortably."
"I am in an attic room and this man is coming to harm me. I must hide. There isn't any place to hide, but I see a pile of clothes and newspapers and burrow under them. I think this is pretty obvious and worry he'll find me quickly. He comes in, tall and big and scary. He looks for me. He stands right next to the clothes. I lay there motionless, hoping. Then as he turns his back, I slide even further down until I'm under the floorboards in a tiny layer between two levels of flooring, again in a tiny, confining space, a box, a coffin. He looks out the window, wondering if I had gone out on the roof and decides I wouldn't do that; too scary. He leaves to go look for me downstairs. I go out the window and up on the roof. It is scary and high. I see a neighbor and mouth to them, ""Get the fire department,"" thinking they could rescue me. I worry they'll come too close, not understanding me, and he'll get that I'm on the roof before help arrives."
"I was working for my dream class instructor as a researcher.  The people in the lab were all mentally ill, and I was to help take care of them.  There were urine stains everywhere because not everyone could control themselves.  Most of the lab was very dark.  I sat down in a room at a computer, and had trouble figuring out how to get the sound through the headphones only, so I wouldn't disturb the clients.  I followed a client into a room with tanks and equipment like at the observatory.  They said they had to go to the bathroom, and that meant immediately.  I had to get a container for it.  Then, outside, there was a pond, and some dead lizards on the cement."
"I am seated next to a Doctor that looks like the preacher that married Melvin. I say to him, ""You know, just recently I was experimenting with Euphoria and someone gave me a pill called 'Think.' What is your opinion on this?"" Supposedly it was supposed to enhance the euphoria. I wasn't sure."
"I boarded a bus coming from Akron back into Cuyahoga Falls. Sitting in the last seat on the right hand side was a girl with the looks and body and reputation to start pleasant thoughts. I sat down beside her and started a conversation. What was said seemed unimportant for our mouths moved, but I heard nothing. I began to feel her leg. She didn't resist. I asked for her phone number, which she gave me. This seemed foolish for I can still remember her phone number. By the time I had gone far enough with her to know that we both had the same desires, and that she was willing in any case, my bus stop came. I told her I could call her that night. I got off the bus and the dream ended."
I was a hospital patient. I wandered off the grounds. An attendant who resembled an officer at the hospital where I was once confined (Mr. Klitz) Came and led me back onto the grounds.
I was in a room with balloons.  Something happened and the other person and I descended and got into the Batmobile.  I was the sidekick.
I thought I was awake lying in my bed and my housemate's baby iguana had escaped and was crawling towards my face. But it looked more like an alligator than an iguana. It went straight for my face and tried to nip at my nose. And then I woke up.
"(03/18/01)[""Nice older couple and betrayal.""] I am at a women's workshop. We are all sitting on the floor. I see a nice older couple who walk around together, arm in arm. They seem to be kind to each other and love each other. Susie is the lecturer or rather facilitator. As I am watching, the man suddenly says to the woman, ""Maybe I'll just rape you."" I do a double take I am so surprised. She almost doesn't hear it. The whole group goes silent in shock. The woman withdraws her arm and steps back. The man then walks away from her in obvious pursuit of a young pretty woman. He now wears a long black robe with stars and moons on it, like a wizard robe. He is seated with women around him like a harem. The old woman is distraught. I say to her, hold my hand. I will support you. She takes my hand and begins to walk like pacing in a circle around and around dragging me along. I have a hard time keeping up. She then lunges to the man throwing herself prostrate on the ground in front of him. Clutching his legs. We are all shocked and disapproving. She begs him to let her stay with him."
"I'm in the back seat of a car. Terence (my cousin) gets in with me. He wants to neck. He starts kissing me and so forth. I accept it but feel not too good about it. He's my cousin and there are other people in the car. It starts to feel good sexually so I think, ""Eh, what the heck."" Then he says, ""You turn and change position."" He had been touching my breast. Now he wants me to touch his penis. I sit up and move away. I think, ""No, that's going to far. I don't want to."" I start talking to other people in the car (my parents in front, and my brother Dwight next to us). We're driving country roads. My father stops the car by a mailbox to look at a shallow stream. There might be good rock hounding material there. My mother is embarrassed because someone is getting their mail and might wonder why we stopped by their mail box. My father is annoyed with my mother and vice versa. We then drive on. We come to Ka-ne-ta, an Indian Resort. There are lots of people. My father points one out. He calls him a special name. He's a Chief or something. I decide to knit. I open a package, a kit. Part of the knitting has been done. It's a delicate lacy pattern, pink, baby sweater-like."
"I go to a street corner to meet Derek and friends. We're going to a potluck or the park or something. He wheels up, and I hear a narrative voice saying he paid $160 to help his friends get food ready and maybe they won't show up. I feel bad for him, going to all that trouble for possibly nothing. It doesn't seem to bother him. He wheels up and we greet each other happily. I am holding a sweet baby and cuddling her. Now we're going to go on and go to the park and continue, friends or no friends. I am walking and become aware that this is a dream, because I don't ordinarily walk. Realizing this, I decide then that he can walk too and he is now walking. I see his tennis shoes all stiff like, but then he is walking. We are entwined, my arm around him and his arm around me. It is close and intimate and warm. Then, he's back in his wheelchair and invites me into his lap. I and the baby curl into his lap and we laugh and hug. Now we're at the table and I feed him ""his food"" and he feeds me ""my food,"" one forkful. He only eats half of it and I pause, thinking about possible germs, and then shrug and finish off the bite."
"Mary and I are at a movie and the picture is supposed to be some kind of erotic film. If I remember correctly, there is a scene in the movie where several women are wearing masks. But the masks are actually massagers or vibrators. The women close in on a man -- or men -- embrace him/them and press their massagers/vibrators against him/them. In the dream, this struck both Mary and I as very silly -- hardly erotic at all. Mary is laughing and is in good spirits. She turns to me, and says, in high glee: ""I like fucking and sucking, but that's something else."" We decide to leave the movie -- it's so stupid. And as I'm sitting beside Mary, laughing and enjoying myself and feeling so very glad to be with her, I suddenly realize she is dead -- has been dead for 15 months. As I think about this in the dream, I am aware of thinking also that she's not dead. How can she be dead when she is here beside me, laughing and enjoying herself? In this dream I'm dimly aware of being married to Bonnie, but I'm deeply preoccupied with being with Mary and shocked to remember that she's dead. I'm not accepting that Mary is dead because she's with me."
"I was walking with some woman. I had been there before. We passed certain landmarks. There were paths, trees, distant buildings, several stories high. The woman with me was young. I wanted to see her hips. She was shy. Later she said she had bruised herself on her buttocks, and she pulled down her panties and showed me the bruise."
"I went with Matthew for a campus visit to SMW. Although, I'm not sure we were even on campus because it looked much different than waking life. It looked more like we were on a business district street in a small town, and the street was lined with buildings. Each doorway was a different part of the school. I'm not sure if each one was a different area of study, or each one a professor, or something else yet. There were tons of people there, mostly female as SMW is primarily a female college. I was thinking about this and somewhat surprised that Matthew would want to attend a female college, because the men who were enrolled here were working on their masters in Theology. Somehow I came to realize that there were now a small number of young men enrolled in a bachelor degree program there. I don't know if I knew that because I saw a few there that day, or if Matthew said it or maybe someone else said that to me or maybe it was just a remembering in the dream. Matthew seemed to be very interested in the school. He was having a lot of fun there. We were both having a lot of fun. In some place there were people who worked for the school sitting outside of some of the entrances. They were sitting at small tables to greet or answer questions. One woman said something to me about my attitude and energy. something to the effect of how good it is for Matthew to have a Mom who is such fun. I said, but this place is a lot of fun. We went into this room that was some kind of a huge congregating area. In some parts of the room there were large round tables with chairs all around them. In other parts of the room there were sitting areas with sofas and more comfortable chairs. Some of the round tables were occupied by professors and employees of the school. As we were walking through I turned my head a couple of times to look at two of these tables. I'm not sure if I turned because I recognized someone at one of those tables, because I just thought I did, or to see if someone I knew was sitting there. As I did this I lost Matthew. He didn't realize that I was no longer right behind him and he had gotten a bit ahead of me. As I continued a man from one of those tables I had kept looking at stood up and called out to me, asking where Matthew was. I realized that he wanted to talk with him. I think he had already been planning to talk with him. I pointed ahead of me as I said that he was just up ahead of me, but I kept walking. Matthew had stopped to talk with someone else so I caught up with him quickly. He saw me and headed towards me as the man who had spoken to me came up behind me."
"I'm supposed to pick Sharon up after some event - a meeting at Park Presbyterian, I believe - and take her home.  It is to be over at about 10 p.m.  I get started late and I'm getting worried.  I drive out Longhorse Boulevard to the lake, and when I get there I can't remember which way to go to get to Grafton.  I go a ways to the right and come back because it doesn't look like the right way.  By this time, it's about 11 p.m., and I'm really worried.  I come to some swimming pool within a small brick building surrounded by trees.  On the inside, it looks like the pool at Lake Rexorama Lodge.  Doug and I are sharing a basket, and he has the tag.  I have to get out and leave for something, so I have to find him and get the tag.  He is climbing out of the pool right in front of me. I see Sharon later, and evidently she got home alright and isn't mad."
A girl came in from the next room from me and woke up my roommate asking her what time it was. Irma said it was quarter after 6 and Barb called her a liar and insisted that it was 6:30. Irma got quite huffy and they started quarreling. Barb slammed the door and stormed into her room. This woke me up. I was very angry at being awakened from a sound sleep in such a rude way. This dream seemed so real that I was actually surprised to find out that it really never happened.
"Sneaky Delivery  I'm delivering newspapers with my friend Nate Nelling to the house down the block where an old woman lives. I am being sneaky, and try to contact the woman without Nate knowing."
"I am in my childhood home and look out the window. A young Dutch woman friend of mine is upstairs. She tells me to come up because I'll have a better view from up there. So I come up to another room on the same (top) floor. She says, ""Come, come here, you'll see better."" So I go into the room. It's the great love of my youth. She is just as beautiful as in the past. Her legs are covered with a blanket and I kiss her feet through the blanket."
"Naked Dishwashing  I'm with my coworker Jenny working at Fishing Haven. We're in the back room. She is washing dishes, and I'm supposed to dry them. I am naked. I dry some dishes while I am naked. I am not totally embarrassed, but am a bit uncomfortable since I'm the only one that is naked. I decide to get dressed. I walk into the packing room from the back room where we were doing dishes. I put on my red underwear, which are all stretched out and full of holes. I woman is on the phone and can see me. I pull my underwear up and adjust them as best I can."
"I saw a ""sci-fi"" movie out of the corner of my eye. A godzilla monster tearing--"
"I dreamt that I was in a very old and dilapidated hospital which I did not know, and nobody came to visit me there. The other patients got lots of visits; their relatives went there and brought them food, magazines, and stayed with them a long while. The other patients and their relatives looked strangely at me. I got the impression that they did not want to get close to me. I couldn't understand this. I was alone, sad, and did not know how to get out of that situation. I knew that I could ask the people around me for help or try to communicate with them, ask them why they had that attitude. I understood this, but something seemed to stop me from doing it. I could not speak; however, I was not quite desperate because it made me happy to see the other patients talk among themselves, smile and wait for visiting hours. Every once in a while I would react to what was happening to me and I would look at the other patients, and try to catch their attention, making gestures. I would move back and forth in the bed, but since they did nothing about it, I felt like crying, but I controlled myself. Then a nurse appeared, and when she saw me like that, she looked at me mysteriously, and came back after a while with a shot which I did not want her to give me. I tried to defend myself, but she grabbed my arm with strength and gave me the shot. I think I fell asleep, but not too soundly because I heard noises of metal instruments being handled and I did not want to open my eyes. I heard voices whispering, men's and women's voices. I can't tell what they were saying, but an authoritarian voice said, ""To the room,"" ""To the operating room!"" It must have been the voice of a doctor. I felt that my bed was being moved. I wanted to speak, but could not do it, so I tried to move, but I was numb. I kept hearing voices, among them I recognized my mother's, so I wanted to make a big effort to speak to her. I was going to open my mouth and I saw a shadow in front of me. More or less at that point, I awoke. Surroundings: the hospital room where I was, was white, but there were cobwebs in the corners, everything was dusty, and the ceiling, walls and floor were cracked. The patients wore white and blue striped gowns, the beds and beddings were white. I did not know any of the patients, except I could tell they were older than myself. The same goes for their visitors."
"I was a candidate for the witness protection program and I dreamed that I was being relocated to California. I was extremely upset and sobbing hysterically because of the thought of never seeing friends or family again. The morning of the day that I was supposed to leave, for some reason I was up, stripping beds. I could feel the sheets in my hands, once I bent down and touched a bare mattress. But then I paused and realized that I didn't even know what was expected of me, why was I stripping beds? I don't even know what I am supposed to be bringing with me."
I saw the clouds from a storm out in towards Big City hanging down to the earth like a tornado. I ran for home to tell my family to hide in the basement. I saw fleet factor in paper. The elevator I ran went up and down fast. I had a hard time stopping it on the floor I wanted it. Joe Kassimere was always having trouble with his brother. He always wanted to fight. I climbed on a shanty and said I would keep the fox or wolf away from me. I had a broomstick in my hand and intended to keep the animal away or knock it off the shanty.
"It was the morning of Carla's birthday. It was 10:00am and her party was to start at 11:00am, and I had not yet gone shopping for the food. I rushed to the store with my mother. I couldn't remember how many hamburgers and hotdogs. Then I realized I didn't make the cake. So I saw them making the cakes and I saw one perfect for the party. The lady said I couldn't have it; it was for someone else. I asked if she could frost me one just like it. She went to work. I went back shopping. Then I got a call. The people were there to set up the air jumper, but they needed their money. I sent my mom back with the money. I got all I could remember. The cake got done and I rushed back to the house. People were already there. I had forgot the ice for the Sno Cone machine. My mom went to get some. The air jumper was set up and the kids didn't want to jump in it. I got the ice and made the Sno Cones but they didn't want any. I was upset. Nothing was going right."
"Dovre tries to suck my breast, which is fully covered with bra and blouse. I put my hand between her mouth and my breast. I think, ""She's too old to nurse."" She's maybe 4 or 5 years old."
"I was walking through unfamiliar streets. I found myself in the rear of a Catholic church which looked modest, but artistic."
"Bonnie and I are homeless. We have learned though. We have long johns and mittens, ear muffs, etc. I think, ""Being without a home is better and safer because it's real. When we thought we had a home, we didn't protect from the cold because we believed we should be warm, even though there was no heat in the house. We walk upstairs and a stair, path through the woods. There are patches of snow and particles of dry wooden path. I am glad to see the dry patches, some places to sleep when we get tired."
"I was back in high school walking down the corridors during passing time. Everyone there was in college; all of my college friends were there, but none of my high school friends. I was trying to get to my math class, but I couldn't find it. I kept walking into all of the wrong rooms."
"An Italian counterfeiter decided to go straight, and he burned the plates and melted them."
I wanted to get to an underground place. I had to sink through a noxious smelling fluid to get there. The openings were about 2 feet square. Someone else was sinking through a nearby opening.
I was in a barracks listening to a radio. It seemed that it was time to leave then almost immediately I was outside walking away from the barracks. I could still hear the radio and it seemed that there were other men around. They were complaining about being awakened by the radio too early. A short distance farther on there was a fellow on the sidewalk with a microphone. He was putting it away or getting it out but I don't know which and he didn't seem to either.
My oldest son shoots a rabbit and uses my hand to get it and gets a rat bite. I am trying to find someone to take care of it. Even a dentist or eye doctor. No one is around. I am in the hospital in my hometown and someone named Dr. Ran comes in. He makes a big issue of being covered up to work and doesn't want to get dirty but decides to do it. We are puzzling over where the rat came from.
All I remember this morning is that I was earnestly telling someone how much I admire Professor C.
"I am in the teacher's lounge getting ready to do my Evangeline thing. I am choosing my scripts to do and getting them laid out. A male teacher likes me and he's kind of a drunk. I try to avoid him and he leans into me and I back away and so on. Then I notice it is nearly 1 o'clock, and someone is on stage talking. I was supposed to be first because I had a 1:30 appointment across town. I am flustered. Now I can't find the scripts that I had set aside and they are calling me to the stage. I'll be late, but I go on toward the stage, asking Bonnie to look for my scripts for me and bring them to me when she finds them. I then see my cute little girl with ringlets in her hair. She has a huge bag of barbeque potato chips. It is ripped open and she's snacking. I say to her, ""Come here!"" She walks away toward the auditorium, trying to avoid me. I say, ""Don't you do that! Come here now."" She does, resentfully. I say, ""You went home and got these, didn't you?"" (Apparently we lived next door to the school.) She nods yes. I say, ""Don't do that again."" She frowns. I take away the bag of chips. I go up on stage and I'm introduced. Only a few teachers are in the lunchroom audience. I am walking. I apologize and explain that the scripts are missing and are being looked for. I chat about how I started the Can Do show on cable TV and had to create a show every two weeks. We called it heart attack theatre, because we'd have two weeks to prepare for the show. Somehow at the beginning of the two weeks it seemed we had plenty of time, but then it would be Thursday night and I'd have to produce the show. I had no time to rehearse and memorize my lines, so I created a character who had her words on a piece of paper. Clever huh? I went on it in this realistic way. Bonnie comes in with the red notebook of original scripts. I search through it to find a script. I see computer docs. It is past 1:30 and I'm late, but oh well. Maybe Bonnie can call and tell them that I am going to be late. Things just aren't working out. Everyone seems OK with it all."
"I was a delivery driver in Green City. Here there were a special kind of spiders which would help you find your way: they laid their eggs around a light and made it glow. Then I was in a fancy Indian Southwestern hotel which was like a movie theater. There were a lot of porn stars, and an orgy. A lot of dead rich people. They left me and Laura stuff."
"It made sense at the time. I travelled across a lake halfway submerged in a boat type thing several times to a large cave in the side of a cliff. There were some people in the dream. Setting: An unknown lake. Characters: An unknown 20-something male and some unclear people. Feelings and Thoughts: Worried, dutiful."
"I was at the top of the road to go up to my old house, with some of my old neighbors, and two guys who were about 15 or 16. They put me on a motorcycle and I just kept going down the hill (not stopping), and I have no control over anything. I've had this dream a few times."
"(12/15/99)[""Al Pacino in drag.""] Al Pacino works for the police department. He also runs a theft ring. Mostly they steal lipstick and women's clothing. I see him putting on bright red lipstick. He has luscious full lips."
"Hunting for the manuscript of the research I had started I'd handed it to L. Now I could find only fragments and couldn't carry it on. LK came to help. I should have handed it to him; wasn't he here when I started the research? ... In a schoolroom. She was shutting windows. I say it'll be too warm. If the draft is too much for her, why doesn't she move? But she won't. A young blonde girl comes in and sits down in the first front corner seat. I say, ""I think that was mine."" She starts to move but I tell her it's all right to keep the seat."
"A Native American man is nearby. I am working hard, resenting the work and feeling overwhelmed. I am doing the dishes and trying to organize piles of papers. He says to me lovingly, ""I'll do the dishes for you. It's all right."" I feel guilty and relieved. He assures me it is no problem. He would love to help me. I uneasily let him. I now try to straighten the papers. He says he will do that too. I then start to dance around in a circle, slowly at first and then with more pep and fun. I like the dance. So does a small dog, maybe a Terrier, who leaps into my arms on one of my dramatic twirls. It looks so cute and the Native American watches lovingly, happy to see me happy. I do it again, with the dog, just to feel the endearing smile of the man. Now I see another man, actually a suit of clothes all folded up, only a thin, ill man is in it. I pick him up gently and hold him. I have great empathy for him and his pain. I smile tenderly and say, ""I understand how hard it is and how beautiful it is when you can reach that moment when you can love the pain and yourself. It is a rare moment and hard to get to. But it is ecstatic when you get there."""
"Feels like the same ol' chicken soup dream yet I don't know if I've ever dreamt about this soup before. Crush was playing. My dad hired them I think. They played in this church/bar parking lot. Nobody came. I was pissed cause they would take long 1/2 hour breaks or longer between each song. I tried to tell them they sucked but would then just apologize for what I said. In the parking lot, 2 other bands were practicing quietly. One band wore all cavemen outfits and they were set up like Hollywood Squares. I wanted to go camping. I had this favorite trail that I started doing over and over again. It almost became like a personal race course. There was one area where the trail split. The one way I never went, went across a river. There was a lean-to. The lean-to, as I eventually found out one day was a loft with a nice double bed, a closet, lights - just like a regular bedroom. It had once belonged to the woman who owned 14 K. Street. A lot of her stuff was still in there - clothes, books, curtains, photo albums. There was also my moms storage stuff like a sewing machine and thread. I looked throughout the album and saw a picture of the lady as a little girl. She looked exactly like me. A little boy looked just like Eric. In another picture the father looked like Roger. I ripped a picture out. When I got back from hiking, the band was still on break - I'm pissed. I tell everyone that we should all go camping and stay in the lean-to and that I'll make some French Onion chicken soup. Ronny tells everyone that my soup sucks. Ahmad asks him why he doesn't make it then and Ronny says because he hates it but if Ahmad gets him 30 lbs of dog meat then he'll cook it for us the right way. I show my mother the picture and she is surprised. Sam and Kim said that they would go camping but then Kim backs out. So Sam asks if just he and I would want to go. Hmmmm, i think, that would be fun. He wants to climb a mountain though, and not go on my special trail (which is basically flat) with the lean-to. One thing i forgot....when I was going down hills on the trail it almost had the affect of skydiving. I felt like my hands were holding onto two bannisters and I would slide down the slope from he sky. Sometimes the geography would turn into a map-like feature. I could see small trees and the outline of the path and I would try to aim for that. The size of the tree tops were about the size of quarters. [Crush = college band with good friends; Eric = my brother; K. Street = street my parents live on; Roger = mother and fathers friend; Ronny = friend; Ahmad = love interest at the time; Sam = friend, goes out with Kim; Kim = friend, goes out with Sam]"
"Deli Court  I'm about to eat dinner. I look in a refrigerator case. There are some loaves of bread in it. Some of the bread comes with meat: it looks like two small loaves of bread with a clump of sliced meat in between them. There is one loaf of bread for 35 cents. It is from the 36-hour famine. It looks good to me: it's a big, long loaf of soft white bread. I grab one bottle of beer out of the refrigerator. Others are eating with me. I think of getting a beer for each of us: that would be a nice thing for me to do. My old flat mate Glen Ryan and my coworker Herald Jamison are there.  I'm in court, which is a deli. Herald is on trial. My name is called to go to the witness stand. I'm surprised, and feel pressure. I'm sworn in. I put my right hand on a tub of hummus. I hold the tub with my thumb around the edge and my four fingers over the top. I try to keep my hand flat while holding it. The woman bailiff swears me in, asking me if I promise to tell the whole truth. I say, ""I do."" As I'm sworn in, my right hand and arm falls down, it seems as if the bailiff isn't holding the bible (hummus) anymore. I quickly glance at the judge to see if this makes a difference. The judge doesn't flinch, so I guess it's okay. I'm then on the witness stand. It's about six feet square bounded by a one or two-foot high fence made of wood or wire. The judge is to my right, at about 2:00. There are some ovens and some deli cases to the right of the judge. The prosecuting lawyer is questioning me. He is a young blond man. He asks me the name of the deli manager. I say her name is Patty. I don't know her last name, I say. He asks me if I see her in the courtroom. I say no, she isn't here. He then asks me if the inspector is there, meaning the health inspector at Mountain Market. I stand up and look around the courtroom/deli. I really don't know who the inspector is. By process of elimination I come up with a few people in the room who could be the inspector, based upon where people are sitting and whom I know has some other role in the room. I point out one man, and say that could be him. He is wearing a gray sweater and has gray hair. He is a big person. I say I don't really know if he's here: when we work we all have different tasks, and I just haven't taken notice of who he is. The lawyer then asks me several vague and indirect questions. I don't know what he's trying to demonstrate: where he's going with his line of reasoning. I'm very direct with him. I say very firmly, ""Why don't you tell the court where you're going with this."" He arrogantly says that he will. He then brings up my criminal history. I immediately feel threatened and think he may expose my speeding ticket or expired tab citation, or my stealing meat and cheese from the deli. He starts to talk about my life. He is speaking pure lies, trying to degrade my credibility. He says I missed bail three times. I realize that this guy is talking out of his ass: he doesn't have a clue about me. I yawn and stretch and scratch my head in contempt for him. I look around and see my friend Sam Kingsley and a woman who works at Mountain Market. By their facial expressions I know they know that the prosecutor is making it all up. The prosecutor rambles on without making a point. The people who know me know that what he is saying isn't true. My lawyer, who is Herald's lawyer, but seem seems like my lawyer or is on my side-because I seem to be on trial-is a woman with short straight dark hair. She is pretty. As I'm testifying a timer for the ovens go off. Patty, who is near the judge's bench, switches some food, maybe ribs, in the oven as the trial takes place."
"I go ice skating with X. (a female friend). We are both dressed too lightly for the very cold rink and the rented skates don't fit quite right, but I am having fun anyway."
"I am seated in the front row of the audience with friends (Bonnie, Tyler). I now get up and walk up the steps of the raked auditorium (like a school gym, M City High, the old one). I go higher and higher, noticing that the higher I go, the fewer people there are, and the ""lower"" the intellect and class they have. I reach the top and it's just empty seats. I walk across to the righthand aisle and walk down. Some of the steps are like steep dirt banks I have to jump. I get almost down to where I was and cross again to the left and then return to my seat. As I pass my friends, they excitedly tell me that a Fire Fair is going to happen, like I'll be thrilled, but I'm a bit annoyed because it's like when people tell me some thing about disability, I've heard it all before and I do have other interests besides disability."
Me and my family were going on vacation and my Mom was on an airplane. She was coming and we heard there was an airplane crash and she died. We were really sad and I started crying. Then I went to school and I told my friend Polly and this girl Karen and another friend Nancy. They didn't really seem to care. I started picking up coins on the floor. A man came up and told me about the crash and I started crying more.
"It felt as though I woke up, sat up in my bed, saw three tables sitting to my left, gave some thought to the things that were sitting on them, and then laid down and went back to sleep. This happened more than once. [I don't have three tables sitting to the left of my bed in waking life. I don't know if I woke up to any degree and can't say with any certainty if I sat up in bed or not.] Later, someone came in and talked to me. I was in a room on a cruise ship setting up displays for fifteen SAID stores. I had three, square tables sitting in a row along the wall. Each had just a few things sitting on them. Each table was a different store. I needed to determine the best layout in this room to set up the fifteen tables."
"I'm telling my husband about what I thought was a right foolproof scheme if you were going to make some corn liquor, some moonshine, and you didn't want to be caught. I figured out a way to do it. It does sound pretty good, even now. What you would do is get a house with a big basement and a big hot furnace, maybe one of these coal-burning types, and you'd fix your still somehow so it would be right close to this furnace. You could fix something coming out from the furnace that would supply heat to your still so that you could distill your liquor. The whole thing was supposed to be mounted on wheels so if anybody did come snooping around, you could just, quick, shove the whole thing off into a closet somewhere so they wouldn't find it. We were talking about distilling wine, making wine, and we were wondering if you would distill it in any way and sort of reading a recipe or being read a recipe by somebody, and at the same time seeing this operation being carried on. The scene sort of took place in front of this large white farmhouse, somewhere out in the country. Finally we were there and this wine bit sort of faded into the background. These people were just moving into this house, this older couple and sort of a foreign couple. I guess they were in their middle 30's or something. They seemed to be somebody we knew, but I don't know who they could have been, really nobody that I can place. So we were going thru the house. I think they were showing us the house or something, and it was fairly nice, large rooms and attractive. In the kitchen, the kitchen was in two parts and in one part the woman put up a lot of dishes she wasn't going to use and wrapped each one of them in this white shelf paper, which seemed like an awful lot of work, but she had done this, and had shelf paper on the shelves under them too. The next episode in this dream was very vaguely similar to one of the things that would occur in gothic novels because it was concerned with a much oppressed heroine who -- oh, there was somebody sinister. It all took place in this farmhouse which was about as unsinister as it could be, but there was something sinister. I was trying to find the appropriate moment or something to see what was going on and so I had this book I had read in real life in my hand, which had indexed all these events. So I was going thru the index trying to find it, but I couldn't find it."
"The Confrontation Meeting  I'm crawling on the floor of an office building, going to a meeting at Armstrong High School. I enter a hallway. There are photocopies on the wall of some pictures of maps of a brain that are in a book. The book is there. It is black and has to do with the brain, mind, and maybe dreams. A teacher at the school is reading it. I pick it up briefly and look at it: It looks interesting, new. I go to the meeting. I'm ten minutes late. I'm the first student there. There are three teachers or administrators there waiting, one of whom is my religion professor Grace Kurkowski. I walk in and sit down directly across from these three, although there are other seats available. I sit firmly, plainly, and directly across from them, like I'm confronting them and mean business. It is obvious that no students care about the meeting."
"I'm walking around downtown in my raincoat and hat, not really knowing what to do. A woman comes up to me and asks me for change, but I remind her that she's already asked me twice today. She groans and takes off to a group across the street. ""Wow!"" I exclaim to myself, ""Amy is over there!"" I hadn't seen her since Junior High, so I walk over to her and say hello. She gives me a partial hug and we talk for a while. After a brief conversation, I pretend to be a Mafioso, and I look across the street at all the brand new seventeen story magnificent gleaming coffee places. I hop across the street, and take off my jacket. An old lady walks up, and I whisper something to her in Italian. She nods knowingly, and disappears. I put my coat back on, look around shiftily, and go inside and get an espresso."
"I was in a classroom at my school and was sitting in a circle with a teacher and a group of people. The teacher brought in some strawberries that were in a huge crate. None of them were ripe, but she didn't seem to notice. She passed them around for everyone to take a handful. Laura commented about them, but only I heard her. Then the teacher brought out really bruised peaches and passed them around too. ""Anyone who likes to make sherbet, these work really well,"" said the teacher. ""Peaches are my favorite fruit,"" I said to Zena. Later in the car, Leah's friend Mindy had gotten the extra peaches and was carrying them in a plastic bag. ""Can I have one?"" I asked. ""Sure."" ""Can I?"" asked Zena. ""Yeah."" ""Can I?"" Leah asked. ""Leah, you already have two."" ""NO"" said Leah, keeping the O on her lips. ""Yeah, they're in that bag."" Leah started sulking. ""Come on you guys, hey, guess what?"" said Terri. ""I'm getting a new car."" ""When?"" ""Next week."" ""What kind?"" ""I don't know yet."" Setting: In a classroom and in Terri's car. Characters: Zena, my friend. Leah, her little sister, sulks a lot. Terri, their mother, has a beat up Volvo. Laura, an old friend, likes to say bad things about people or objects. Teacher, someone at My school, don't remember who. Mindy, girl in second grade, barely know her. Class - I don't remember. Feelings and Thoughts: Happy, angry, appreciative. It could have happened, but I don't know why this particular group would be together."
"Derek is the king and now I am the queen, only now Derek disappears and I am prisoner in the palace, all these men wanting to control me because of my power. My little girl and I have a secret bathroom we can go to in a house trailer. We have potty bowls. She has to poop, I have to pee. My dress is ornate and formal with the official queen logo on the front. As she and I wander around, I cover the logo and my face so no one will know I am the queen."
"(12/29/99)[""Traveling to a party and computer connections.""] Dovre is going to a party later. I am walking back down a road to the house to change and then join her on the trip to the party. I decide to not bother and start walking back to where Dovre is. I see my father's VW bug (yellow) on the side of the road and realize there is a toddler little girl in there waiting. The motor is left on, idling. I am concerned and ask the girl to turn off the key. My father shouldn't have left it running. The girl finally does it. Then a friend, perhaps Shannon comes down the road. I realize I had left her behind. I try to make up for it and tell her where we will meet for the party. I have a map. I point to the fossil resort across the state. We get there. Now it is like an Ricardo and friend are going to an important party where venture capitalists may be. I am trying to dress to go there. They burst into the room as I struggle to get my bra and fuzzy sweater on. My breasts are exposed and I duck down behind the bed as we talk. They realize I'd been left behind and want to represent me at the party. I am confused but grateful they will not forget me entirely."
"I was outside.  There was some defense, and a bat with Bart Simpson's head attacked.  That wasn't the fear.  The part of the evil much bigger, much stronger.  We had no chance."
I saw two men fighting. Then they were stubborn and neither wanted to give in that he lost the fight.
"I pass two people sitting in the patio and start up the very wide steps of the Home (King's Daughter's home where I am now and where Miss Drum has lived and where I then visited other friends. Quiet hour really 1 to 2:30 p.m.) to see my fiend. They call to me I can't visit now. It's quiet hour until 4 p.m. I thought it was over at three. I came back and said I wanted to find out if Miss Drum (now dead) was still in 132. They said I could ask at the office. I find no one there and tell them so. One of them rises and says she will phone Emily, does so and I learn that Miss Drum is still in 132."
"Merle and I are in a swim pool. I don't want him to revive his desire to have a relationship. I try to avoid him. It hurts his feelings, but he manages it. He doesn't pursue the relationship stuff."
"(06/26/97)[""Hiding in a crowd.""] I am in a large warehouse sized room, which is very crowded with people. There are some bad guys around and I am using the crowd to mill around in as a way of hiding. Then I get braver and am organizing a talent show. I am performing and becoming more prominent in the crowd. Now I am in danger because they can easily find me. I run out the door and they chase me. I flap my arms and start flying. I have to think myself higher. Then I think to fly without flapping, or I'd get too tired. The sky is clear and blue which is bad because I'm an easy target now. They are shooting arrows at me. I take off my sleeveless white blouse and use it as a sail, attaching it to a stick (I just happen to have with me) It also conceals me so I am a bit safer. I think up a cloud and go into it to hide."
"Brian has made miraculous improvements. He has muscle strength, and now he speaks clearer. I am very pleased. I lay down in his wheelchair with him. He holds on to me and hugs me desperately. I start to get up, but his need is so great just to cuddle with someone, so I stay. His nurse or attendant, whom I had hired, is shocked and threatens to quit her job. I talk to her and help her understand that nothing bad happened. I just gave him some basic affection. She agrees to stay. I feel relieved. I think I was reassuring myself as much as her. Later, Brian walks in, leaning on others. I start applauding, and others join in. There is feeling of joy."
"Our family bought a large house which had a garden that had for a long time grown wild. My grandfather cleared a large space in the back and built a grill. However, a little white-haired old man living next door told us it was a foolish thing to build. However, that night when we gave a large party he and his wife came to it. Interpretation The little white haired man was probably a neighbor of ours who died recently. He was very particular about not allowing any dogs or children in his garden. Answers to questions 2. No particular emotions3. I was just an onlooker.4. Neither5. No6. This dream was in black and white."
"I am in my wheelchair and go down this hall/porch. I see two girls (college age) seated at several wheelchair-height desks trying to decide whether to buy them or not. I pull up and say, ""They won't be helpful for school. Too cumbersome to carry and fold and besides, they have tables there, but for home they're OK."" They thank me and I go on in the house. The kitchen is a mess: dishes in sink, paper sacks on floor. I start to clean out the leather tool pouch on my waist. A huge screwdriver handle I think, ""Wow that's big! And then it's a bottle of smooth liquid ""power supply"" oil. I keep that. Then I open a bottle of assorted pills and pour them out - some big white calcium tablets, some tiny white ones (cortisone) and some bird shaped ones, like in jewelry (broken). Someone knocks on the door. I answer. A man asks, ""Is this where they want info on funerals?"" I say, ""Oh. That was last week. We already had the funeral."" He looks incredulous, so I explain. I didn't want the funeral parlor stuff, but I wanted the body to be properly fixed (embalmed). He finally shrugs and leaves. I say to Ellie, ""Go get the cat with the ribbon and sign on it and take them off her. We don't need to advertise anymore."" I continue to cleanup. I pull out a bottle of whiskey and tell Ellie to put it on top of the fridge or wherever booze (spirits) is kept."
"I was in a bar with people I didn't know. There was a little girl with blonde hair. You could tell it was real blonde because the light shining on the face, the little tiny hairs on her arms and face were blonde too. She was staring in the mirror and I was staring at her. We did not move. Still like chess men. We were back in the TV couch room. She had gotten accepted to Wisconsin State and met a guy 5 days before. They were getting married. She left and I was laying on the couch with her fiancée. I was laying on my back and in front of the TV but not watching it. He was laying on his back with his head in my lap. He had a bald head. He rolled his head from side to side on my lap and it felt good. Then the blonde girl came back. She was exasperated. She said, ""What was I thinking? I'm NOT going to Wisconsin and I'm NOT getting married. The guy got up to try and change her mind but she was already gone. I put on a thick cotton gauze yellow dress. Daffodil yellow. It had one inch shoulder straps but I unzipped the dress and let it fall to my waist so when I walked it dragged the ground and the wind would blow and it would fly out like Batman's cape behind me. My kitty liked to walk just inside the wind tunnel of the dress. I was walking down Washington Sq. When I noticed people staring at me and I realized I was half-naked. I went into the first building on the right that looked friendly. Sure enough there were apartment keys in the elevator. I pushed 3 and 8 but I knew I was going to 11. The dial had no numbers just notches. 2 dials. One above the other. There were 12 floors. I stopped at 3 and 8 but I didn't get off until 11. When I got there it was a fancy apartment but in a way it was very plain. The refrigerator door was open. The house was very neat, but inside the freezer was helter skelter. I set out to make some ice. I filled an ice tray and put it in the freezer. I left the freezer door open but the ice made so quick I could not believe it. I took out the ice and set out to make some more. If I closed the freezer and refrigerator door it would make real fast, I bet, but I had to leave. The folks coming back might shoot me if they came back on Sunday afternoon and a stranger was making ice in the refrigerator. I was in a chicken restaurant that was expanding. They had crazy rules--old/new. They guy in front of me ordered a chicken breast and baked potato. I didn't know what to order so I didn't order anything. A girl and boy were teaching me to dance a dance. The girl was teaching me. The boy was taking pictures. I didn't know which way to go. I was standing in line to go to the bathroom in a school. Then a black male teacher came in with a line of little kids. They all had to go to the bathroom. It was taking way too long. Long. The teacher told the kids to unbutton and unzip their pants and drop them while standing in line so they would get done sooner. The children's eyes told me they were scared but they were scared NOT to do as they're told so they stood in line with their pants down looking scared in their eyes."
"We have a Christmas Eve celebration: invite all the lonely people we know; one black man insists on sleeping in the dog house. He told me that he was no longer a counselor at the Counseling Center but a dentist, and he cleans my teeth as ""payment."" After much talk about counseling, I remember to light the candles."
"I was in a hospital bed, but not sick, just sleeping there. I had a paper wad. I shot it with my finger and it stuck on the ceiling. Henry at Dill's asked who had his 22 pistol. I saw Dick Shebek. I told him Henry wanted his pistol that he loaned to him some time ago. I saw a nurse give a lady a check. Her picture was on the wall."
"I am visiting in Dover and meet a large woman who is a comedian and runs a restaurant in her home. I'm with Ginny. I want to tell this woman that I am a comedian too, but feel hesitant and shy. Finally I open my back pack, which has two zipper panels, to get my tapes to share with her. I see food in there, eggs, sandwiches, etc., that we had packed for the day. I hope the tapes aren't getting ruined. I tell her that the one tape is my comedy character, Evangeline, and the other one is my poetry, just plain poetry. I see that the picture on that tape is me in my wedding dress. All I see is the veil as my back is turned. She takes the tapes and thanks me. I haven't the courage to tell her I'm selling them and feel badly I let her have them without any money, but it's OK sort of because its networking. Later she gives me two tapes of her material and we're even. We are in her living room where a small group of people are having dinner at the one table of her restaurant. Now a CP man in a chair grabs my hand and wants me to run along side him. Off we go and I'm yelling angrily, ""I can only do this with skates."" Over and over I yell that, but he doesn't get it and drags me along. Finally I get him to stop and I angrily ask him why didn't he listen to me. I know I didn't exactly yell stop! but anyone with a brain could tell that's what I'm saying."
"I was getting change from a store after I purchased something. In with the ones they were giving me back were a few 100's mixed in. Some were red and others were orange. They looked like fake money. I took them to my manager at work and asked her if they were valid. She said they were, and I was very happy."
"After he left, another young man came out from behind the reception desk. I told him I was waiting for Debbie Phillips [unknown in waking life]. He said, oh yeah you have some forms to fill out. At that point I felt like I was a new employee. I don't know why I thought that. He walked away and I was just kind of wandering around the front office area there. There was an antique sewing machine there. Very similar to mine only I remember thinking how large it was and how I guess this interested in it. I remember thinking how much I like antiques. There was no name on it. It didn't have the make of the sewing machine like mine has on it. I don't remember seeing the pedal at the floor, but I walked around the front and pulled some of the drawers open. There were papers and stuff in there. At that point, the second young man came back out. I said, sorry, I'm just really interested in antiques. I have an antique sewing machine, but this one is larger and I was somewhat intrigued by it. He said, oh, that's okay."
"I am a housewife and cleaning up the apartment. It is constant work and I do it willingly. I fold clothes, do the dishes, cook meals, and care for the small kittens. I pick it up and cuddle it saying in a soft sweet voice, ""Oh, there's the little kitty."" Later, I have children, two half-grown boys and a six-year-old girl. I then am lighting the candles and am dressed in a 1950's housewife, pretty for my hubby, and he walks in the door with an unexpected dinner guest.  I am distressed, but handle it gently and with dignity. Later, I am cleaning up, he's now drunk and off to bed calling for me to come to bed and I am still cleaning up the sink from after the dinner. Woman's work is never done. [BL]"
"Mason Alarm  I am in Mason Cafeteria at Brimson. My friend Brittany Johnson is sitting at a table trying to raise money for someone's grandma named Karla, who has died. I am picking up change on the floor (pennies, dimes, nickels, and quarters) and putting them in my pocket. A person I work with at the Brimson Library, name Don, is there. I say that it too bad about grandma Karla. I am upstairs in the cafeteria now. There are escalators instead of stairs. I am at the top of the escalator. There is a long line to get food. The big football player who looks like my supervisor from Grocery Getto, Loren Voigt, says something to me about going to the back of the line. I say shit, I don't want to wait! I put my hand on the railing of the escalator and hit an alarm. A buzzing bell goes off. The food server man goes to the panel in the wall with four handles on it. She shuts the alarm off, and then turns on a control alarm. Then he shuts the control alarm off. He turns to the people in line and asks who hit the alarm button. I say it was I: I hit it accidentally, and I'm sorry. He tells me that I'll have to wash the dishes in the cafeteria on the weekend. I tell him I don't even work in Mason! He doesn't care. He gets mad and squirts me with some Palmolive dishwashing soap. I go down the escalator. At the bottom are two Brimson security guards. They are talking. One is holding deodorant. I tell them I have been verbally harassed and assaulted. I ask them what my options are, concerning what to do now. The director of Mason Cafeteria is talking with the guards. I see someone above me run towards where the incident took place. The person running is a black leader. My friend Queen Billman is there. She was with when the alarm went off. She whispers to me that we should just leave. I don't respond to her. I want to be vindicated. It is concluded that the man who squirted me will do the dishes. I explain that he threatened us by telling us we would have to wash dishes. This person is there. He looks different: he has long dark hair, and is not wearing a bandana. He is wearing an apron and his shirt is wet. Queen was also squirted. We leave. I think I'll eat somewhere else tonight. Queen runs and grabs some fruit snacks in a purple package that are on the table of a booth. She hops on a skateboard and skates to her room. I wonder if she is coming back. It seems like it. I walk back to the dorms."
"Leave, Wally  I'm in a place which may be Goldenshire Golf Course in Oak Valley. I'm with a group of friends and my brother Wally. I think my friend Queen Billman is there. My friends say to Wally that either he has to leave or they are going to leave. I say that is pretty mean of them. I leave and go home. I get into the house and see that the parking lights on my truck are on. I have to go out and jiggle the light switch in the truck to shut them off. My jacket and shorts with my wallet in them are in the bathroom, and they fall into the bathtub and get wet while water is draining out of the tub. I carry them and a bunch of other items up to my room. My room is very clean. The light on the ceiling of my room doesn't work: the bulbs must be burned out. I use my little lamp on my bed. Wally has devised some system or score to demonstrate that he wasn't being mean, when people told him to leave."
"I am driving a jeep in the country. The land is green and dotted with old wooden houses. I park near Doug C. and his friend. We begin talking. I hear chopper blades and look up. A Huey with Red Cross markings prepares to land close by. I say to Doug, ""Oh God, it's a Medevac."" Then I am in a bar crowded with soldiers. I recognize several men, though I mistake one man for someone else. I take a long swig from a bottle. I am crying. I want the men to see this. I want the man mistaken for someone else to see this."
"I was talking with the officer named Mr. Thom about getting released. He said I had to do something for him, and then I could leave the hospital."
"I noticed the few poinsettias growing higher against the wall were white but all those lower down were red. It must be the former are shaded by the eaves. Then I noticed some youths were trying to plant more white ones in the crevices of the wall. I noticed table companions were being served pancakes as dessert. I declared I wanted some too.  Pouring some powder into milk, too much. Couldn't stir it all in. Must add water, a little wouldn't hurt. H. wanted the window open. Handed me a small rock to prop it up. The woman with a baby to whom I handed it tried to put it on the sill but it rolled to the edge. Then she put the baby's arms through holes in a turkish towel so he wouldn't feel cold and he was delighted."
Earl and his latest girl friend comes to a seminar in N. Town (where Earl really lives); I notice that Earl has lost a lot of weight and is thinner; I wonder if his girl friend had anything to do with it? Also wonder if they will get married.
"I look out the big picture window of the living room of my apartment. Directly ahead, standing in a line by the curbside, are four women with balloons. Each woman has two balloons attached to her chest, making it appear as if she has a very large pair of breasts. Upon looking more closely, I see that each balloon is indeed decorated to resemble a naked breast, including a big nipple at the end. One of the women has painted a hideously elaborate set of blue and red blood vessels on her balloons as well. The women are carrying signs and shouting some sort of slogan. I say to myself, ""These are feminists protesting something."" I go out into the front yard to investigate. There on the lawn is a great commotion: a large number of people are sitting in folding chairs set up everywhere. Many of them are dressed for a political convention, wearing striped jackets with large buttons on the lapel and funny straw hats colored red, white and blue. I am extremely annoyed because these people have occupied my front yard. ""Is this a convention organized by my landlord?"", I angrily demand aloud. No one pays attention as all interest seems turned towards a rectangular table covered with a white cloth at the center of the yard. I fight my way through the crowd, vowing to find out if my landlord is at the center table. I see a few men wearing formal black suits seated behind the table, but my landlord is not among them."
"I heard deep fen or blue fen. I saw a horse race where horses were chained and they pulled or pushed a freight steel car and the one that pushed it against the other won. One horse pushed it against about five or six horses. His chain broke and he ran as a winner. The steel freight car ran over most of the other horses and they lay there dying. One of the horses opened up a trap door and the dying horses fell into a hole of water, for I heard them scream as they fell, and when they landed, they were excited. The other horse closed the trap door. Frank wanted to borrow a half dollar from me to give it to another guy he talked to. I noticed it was on a horse bet that he lost. He then gave the guy about 4 or 5 dollars. I came by GibsonÕs door and called Lassie, but about 4 or 5 pups came out first, then Lassie. A freight train came by and the pups were on the other side of the track. I was afraid they would get killed, but when the freight passed, the pups were walking between the rails on the ties as the freight went over them with harm. I was eating a banana and standing in front of GibsonÕs screen door. I heard first. I watched the coke ovens smoke and did the smoke roll out of them. I went into a country church where there were benches of old wood to sit on. I saw Frank and Donnie there. I saw a bull in a field. I picked up a wet glove. We bought an old house and sold ours. I looked and saw a big man walking. He was in front of a skyscraper and seemed to be as tall as it."
"The dream concerned this little man who was evil and who had somebody that I liked in his power, and I was trying to fight with him, it seems like, and get him to release them or whatever. We were down in the basement of this house. There were a lot of tools around, and we were using screwdrivers and wrenches and various things in this fight because I guess I was trying to kill him. Finally it seemed I wasn't getting anywhere, and so I was going to go. Then he said, ""If you really want to save this person, you really need some of my blood,"" and so as I was trying to kill him again, and I noticed something that I hadn't seen down there before was this sort of long, well I guess it was a machete, this knife with a big handle. It was about 3 feet long. So I picked that up and hit him with it on the foot. I really didn't expect it to do anything, but it seemed to be very sharp and then I cut him on the neck a couple of times and he fell down and was dead. Then I found some Kleenex that I was getting. There wasn't actually a whole lot of blood, but I was getting some on his Kleenex in order to save this person. The little man who I had killed then turned out to be my mother, and it was my sister who I was going to save. I wasn't at all upset that this was my mother that I had just killed. The only thing that worried me was that I was probably going to get caught. So I took this knife, which now turned out to be a saw, an ordinary carpenter's saw, and I took some Kleenex and sort of wiped over it, carefully trying to get any fingerprints there might have been off of it. Then I went on upstairs from this basement. The basement was quite a bit like the one in my husband's home in his hometown, but upstairs it was like our house in my hometown. My brother was in the kitchen with this big pile of laundry he was getting to go down in the basement with and I thought, ""Well, when he gets down there, he's going to see mother lying down there dead."" So I walked on thru the den or somewhere and there was mother. I was a little bit surprised, and she said she hadn't been feeling too well lately. She had some sort of an allergy or rash on her throat. I thought, ""Well then that's awfully strange. Maybe there's two of them and I just killed the one."" I was neither glad nor sorry to see that she was still there. But anyhow, I went up to where my sister was and she was in bed and took these Kleenex out to put on her. These were supposed to cure her. I don't know what sort of disease she had, but it made all these small sores on her and so I put one of these Kleenex on her breast and one on her head. It seemed to be helping her a lot and making her feel a lot better."
"I was intimating my wife and she said we are going somewhere first. Judy was a little boxer. She had on boxing gloves. Mrs. Kogler was looking for Judy. She came to our door and knocked. I told Judy to let her in and then box her. Judy was kind of afraid when Mrs. Kogler came in, but finally rushed her. Mrs. Kogler fell on her back and put her legs up in the air. I ran up to her and intimated her. She pleaded with me it hurt her, so I let her up."
"I'm at a little gallery or building being used for one, it used to be a house, I imagine. We're setting up an art show in the front room - there are maybe half a dozen artists or less, one of whom is MT, I'm assisting him. This is not just people with oil paintings, it's a variety of things, and what M is showing are little airplanes. They're not replicas, or toys exactly, but they're stylized and cute. The group of people have exhibited together before, and it's a cooperative effort. They've been doing this once a year - though this may only be the 2nd year, I don't know. Anyway, there are people bustling about, putting things up, looking after details. There's somebody in charge, he comes around to check how things are going every now and then, nice polite friendly guy in a suit. One of the things I'm doing is looking out for anything odd. Last year there was a disturbance, a robbery or something, and this time MT has assigned me to poke around and see if there's anything out of the ordinary to suggest something similar might happen. I haven't seen anything, but I have been around to the back of the house and gone into a couple of other rooms. We're behaving kind of like secret agents or something, but we really don't want anything to happen.MT has one of his airplanes suspended on a thread from the ceiling, and I decide it will look better near the entrance where some other things are, to give people coming in a hint of what they'll see. It comes down easily enough, but I'll need help getting it stuck back up, so I go fetch a chair. There's a bar in this room, a padded one like you see in - well, bars, with lots of glasses and it curves around. I get a chair from there. A friend offers to help and I do need it - he's not quite Don Mahon, but that's who I think of. So we tack the thread up where I want the airplane to hang."
"I am walking south on the east side of 17th St., N.W., just south of ""H"" St. about where Roberts photo store was formerly located. I notice an old man (who seemed to have certain characteristics of our ""7th St. philosopher"" and others of the man I saw preceding afternoon in People's drugstore), bare-headed and rather shabby, standing on one side of a tall wooden box next to the curb. The old man answered in a voice having a nasal twang ""I ain't a going to sing today."" Standing on other side of box (which is 6 or 7 feet tall) is George Bernard Shaw who answers ""Oh, ain't you?"" It now became evident that certain celebrities were to gather here and with the purpose of seeing them I slipped into a narrow passage way between 2 buildings, intending to sleep there till morning. This passage way was just about wide enough for a man to walk through. It extended back only 5 or 6 feet where it opened on to the street on opposite side of buildings. Soon after entering this cubby hole I notice McAtle on the curb on 17th St., but do not call out, as I seem to wish to avoid him. Soon a lady, middle-aged, comes in to my sanctum from 17th St., and she is followed by another lady; while a policeman comes in from opposite end of passageway. The policeman continues to stand, but rest of us sit down, and try to get into comfortable positions -- stretch out legs, twist and turn, etc. The quarters are so cramped that the lady who came in first is pressed closely against me, and it is necessary for both of us to adjust our arms so that our elbows do not prove mutually painful."
I was leaning over a balcony watching two women converse. One was young and fair with a cute nose. She had a profound expression on her face. She was telling the other woman about an emotional problem she was having. The other woman was older and stockily built. I tried to get closer so I could hear what she was saying so that I could perhaps help her. But she shied away from me.
"There was a registering TV that moved by itself from block to block and street to street, which was taking pictures of all who registered to. It was to go to eternity or Russia. I'm not sure or clear on this. It was not compulsory for everyone to register."
"I am in China, in the summer program at Hunan Medical University.  The program is a little different from before; now it is split into two consecutive sessions.  I'm not sure whether there are two courses in each sessions or only one, nor am I sure whether I am teaching in the first one.  In any case, I am not prepared to teach in the second session, and it is about a week before that session is to start.  I tell Martha Tuttle that I cannot teach in that session because I don't have time to prepare a class, and I didn't bring any materials with me.  I tell her I will stay and participate in other activities and perhaps give two or three special lectures on topics of my choosing; if that is not possible, I will go home.  I expect her to be upset, but she doesn't seem to be."
"I was in an amusement park. The pool was empty. I did not have subway fare, so I walked."
"People were playing these musical instruments at a big, ballfield, sounded like an autoharp or a musicbox. I wanted to learn how to play an instrument too, it sounded all in unison and really pretty, so somehow I got one, somebody got me one and somehow I was going to learn on my own how to do it so I could be part of the group too and make the pretty music that they all made. Somehow it didn't sound very hard. There was a master of ceremonies that directed the group."
"I want to publish my book and some sleazy agent man is going to help me. It's going to cost. Some woman says I spent ____ money on my book and I said, ""By the time we print it, it will cost us about 5 or 6 thousand dollars."" It's a sort of one-upmanship. Then there is a series of shootings. One man shoots another and two men stand off and fire at each other point blank. I am appalled. One man is my friend. He's laying face down in a pool of blood. A woman cries and wants to help, but is afraid to touch him. I kneel down and inspect the back for a wound. I find none, so I turn him over and see a small bullet hole (22 caliber) near the base of the throat (where a tracheotomy might be). It is bleeding just a little. I am relieved. Then I see a hole near the chest and try to stop the bleeding. He will live."
"A red-haired woman comedian (like the short, plump one from Jay Leno challenge, Lorna) is doing a routine. Then she takes her wig off and her head is balding, little tufts of hair here and there. It looks terrible. I wish she'd kept her hair on."
My boyfriend Jeremy and I lived at my maternal Grandma Jane's house.  It was morning and we were getting ready to go to work or school or something.  I was in a rush trying to turn out all the lights as I headed downstairs.  The last one triggered the Ghostbuster siren as I reached the bottom of the stairs and rushed for the front door.
"Bonnie and I are in a pickup truck traveling back home and she stops and grabs a small calf and kills it, throwing it in the back of the truck. She does this a second time, explaining that the baby calf was pregnant anyway and would have died. I am very upset and say to her, 'This is cattle rustling. At least drive away from the door of where you stole it."" She drives a ways and parks right in front of an old broken down, rotting house. I hear a mean couple arguing. I want to escape there, but sit in the passenger seat, not doing anything. I see Bonnie use a knife to cut open the pregnant calf. She says, ""See, I told you it was pregnant."""
"I went to visit Tim W at WDF. When I arrived, they had made many changes including how to get in. I had to enter one side of the building, climb up and across a wall that had many tools hanging on it. It was a big empty room and there were two men receiving tennis lessons. As I finally made it halfway across the wall, one of the men showed me an easier way to get to the entrance. I went up two flights of stairs and entered the door. It brought me into the company breakroom. I noticed a group of people at one table that included Freda L, Jeff L, and Susan J. They didn't even say hello. I tried to sit down with them and someone made a comment about me taking up too much room. I got up to leave. Then Susan J asked what was wrong. I said no one even said hello. She got up to go with me. She took me on a tour of the new plant. Her area was a special project she was experimenting with. It involved raising African Violets and using the petals to create dyes for fabrics. I then went on without her as she started watering her plants. In the next part of the plant they were showing me how they were testing this dye to create prints on fabrics. One of the people painting was the attorney who shops at NTNS. Now they're using these dyes and this process on people's hair. I was very frustrated with how they were doing it. It was all I could do to keep from saying something. Then they convinced me to let them do my hair. I finally spotted Tim W but he was with his boss. I realized I wouldn't be able to talk with him. As I left, I went back thru the employee breakroom and was spotted by Marcia N. I didn't especially want to see her. She came up to me and spoke briefly. It was much easier getting out of the building than it was getting in."
"I was in Chinatown. The weather was bad. It was cold. We were waiting. People were milling around outside. Most were down on their luck. It started to snow very hard. The wind was blowing. I started to walk. A guy in an army coat started to walk with me. We were not talking. We had our hands deep in our coat pockets and our shoulders hunched up in our collars, heads down, walking into the wind. We got to the first hill on Chestnut Street, in front of the Arnold's house. This is where he got off. I kept walking. I was very early or very late for basketball practice. The locker room was empty. Guys in football uniforms were sitting on the floor in the gym lobby where tickets are sold. I was sent to a group home for wayward girls. We were going on a visit to visit the maximum security group home for extra-troubled wayward girls. They were sitting all over the place on platforms and stairs, complaining that they wouldn't let them cook because of the fires they'd started. They were looking for more trouble. It was pointless to try to make conversation so I went to sit at an old piano on a platform amidst the movie theatre (auditorium) seats and began to play to myself. I hadn't noticed until I started playing that some of the keys were broken. I tried to play anyway but it sounded awful. 2 do-gooders--one man, one woman, walked down the center ramp aisle with crazy eyes--drugged on their own sense of self-importance and feeling so good about themselves in a tranquil way when really they were patronizing and condescending and had no idea what was going on. The man recorded my music and was so glad he got a wayward girl on tape and I told them the piano didn't even work. I know we'd never see these 2 again and he only wanted things to appear like they were going good. The lady shot a B/W film strip and it was in a little plastic canister. She was going to show it but I knew it had not been processed anyway. I left before she showed it. I was wearing my most favorite shirts to play in a tree, but then the red shirt bunched up too much over my 2 green shirts and bag so I took it off. It was time to leave the 46 St. No-cooking beach house for extra-troubled wayward girls. Jasmine was going over some letter spacing with me. She found 3 places in a title I'd kerned that she thought were not perfect."
"I was a witness at the birth of a child. It didn't seem like a hospital, it just seemed like we were in some big room, had to be a delivery room by all practical purposes but it really wasn't I guess. I was allowed to touch the baby as it was coming into the world. I don't know who the lady was and I can't remember anymore. The baby cried and they had me give it a little bit of a spank and it cried and I woke up. This dream was triggered by listening to Rush Limbaugh who was discussing this abortion thing"
"I was living in a big mansion and had just awakened from an afternoon nap. I decided to go swimming in the lake which was near the house. I tried to get someone to go with me. It took a long time to persuade anyone, but at last I convinced them to go with me. However, we decided to go ice-skating instead. I was walking to the pond when I met an old friend, whom I hadn't seen for a few weeks. He was going skating also, but had his boxing gloves instead of ice skates. He tried to excuse himself for not calling me up by saying that he had to go to the doctor for a few days because of a sore hand. When we all reached the pond, we sat in a long row and were asked why the delay. I told the lady in charge that I had forgotten my skates. She thought I was very foolish and everyone was disgusted with me. Interpretation This was a very peculiar dream. The only incident which seemed plausible was the fact that I was wondering why the boy in the dream didn't call me up. He had discussed doctors when I had seen him last because he recently had an appendix operation. I can't understand how the ice-skating got into the dream. Answers to questions 2. Anxious, perplexed, frustrated, disgusted3. Participant4. Unpleasant5. My mansion home (not my own) and walking to the pond6. Never before7. No colors"
"I'm in a small boat in the huge ocean. I'm lost and drifting. A huge Navy ship comes over and a military officer who looks like Paul Newman comes aboard and finds me. I'm nearly dead from lack of food and water. He asks me how much food I had left and I point to a few scraps. I feel superior because I know I'm not a goner yet. So resourceful! He brings me on board the ship. I go to his ""office."" Someone has projected his face up on the clouds and is throwing a ball (soccer) up at him. His hands move clumsily and can't catch the ball. This is supposed to prove there is no God, and if there were, he isn't it. This is damaging to him. He must find the culprit. I know how, but he won't believe me, so I and another woman take over. We call the accused in. I tell him he must sit facing all of us for 3/4 of an hour. The crowd groans because they figure it's a waste of time. I shorten it to 1/2 hour and tell him how if he plays games with us and waits us out, it will go bad at the trial. He will have proven his guilt. Then as he sits there, I explain how it is best if he just tells us the truth. What he doesn't know is that I and the other woman are psychic and are taking notes on his internal responses and we know the whole story."
"I'm just going to the bathroom, I've got a skirt on and I've pulled my pants down, when I hear somebody coming up the steps. I think it must be James, so I leave my pants on the floor and go toward the front door. Before I can get there, it opens - I didn't leave it unlocked, it must have been picked. I yell, Who are you? What do you want? - that sort of thing. He looks at me like I'm a petty annoyance. He looks around like he's deciding what to take or something, and his only response to me is sneering, like, ""Go ahead and scream - nobody will hear you."" But I do scream, knowing that if Tom hears downstairs he'll come out, and maybe others. I manage to get outside and dash down the steps, screaming, help, help, robber, or something. There are some people about, and it takes a few seconds, but they start to pay attention. The man comes out, startled apparently, and makes as if to run away. I start calling out description - he has light brown curly hair, a hat, baggy brown jacket, etc. He looks confused but still trying to be arrogant, makes some threats like, I'll be back, don't you worry. There's a little crowd gathered now, and they look like they'll be all over him if he tries anything. I'm very grateful but still angry. [He goes off in a vehicle, and apparently I chase him, because I encounter him somewhere later, but that part's gone.]"
"In my dream it seems I was at school. I have a friend there who I prefer to all others, and she told me that they had left some homework to be done, and those who didn't do it would be punished. I answered her that I would do it. The day arrived, and I forgot to do the homework. I went to school and when the teacher asked me why I hadn't done it, I told her that I had forgotten. So she said that all the ones who hadn't done it would be punished by having their hair cut short. They were going to cut the hair of a friend and I told them not to cut it, and they said, ""Okay, then you go first,"" and they cut it. In the dream I thought it wasn't true and touched my head until I woke up and realized that my hair was as long as ever."
"I was living in some kind of dormitory or hotel, maybe in Paris.  I got up in the morning and was supposed to meet some people at 8:20 to take a trip.  First I went to the bathroom, only to have some guy at a desk stop me and ask to see my university professor ID.  I thought that was ridiculous, but he wouldn't let me pass without it, so I had to go back.  I ended up somewhere outside, though, and on my way back to the building I met a girl (Annie Soule, maybe) who had just gotten off the subway and was also going to join the group going on the trip.  She said it was already 8:10.  I was shocked.. I looked at my watch and it said 8:55-which, strangely enough, did not prove to me that it was even later than she said, but that my watch had stopped, since that was the time it read when I tried to go to the bathroom, and therefore that was why I was late.  I thought there was barely an outside possibility that I could still make it, but I felt like polio was setting in my legs-they were very stiff, and ached badly, and sometimes collapsed.  She walked with me, though, along the base of an elevated railway.  We reached a building and had to climb the fire escape.  We reached about the fifth floor and she stepped off the edge.  Without a sound, she plummeted to the concrete below.  I couldn't bear to look, and was paralyzed by a state of abject terror.  I collapsed on the spot-a small corner of the fire escape at the corner of the building.  I was scared to move, and for some time I couldn't even utter a sound.  Then I began to cautiously (as if too loud a sound would cause me to fall) to call out hoarsely, ""Adam.  Eve.""  Gradually louder.  Soon I was sure that I must have made someone aware of my presence; I could hear voices around the corner.  I was hoping they would send the fire department to rescue me so I could keep my eyes tightly closed and just lie there.  But they didn't.  Apparently they thought I was planning to jump, and they handed my daughter Christina to me around the corner to discourage me from it.  This was the last thing I needed, and I was more horrified than ever.  I began shouting at them to take her back, and then screaming hysterically.  And I blamed it all on the guy with his bathroom ID regulations."
"Crunch Time  My mom is teaching piano lessons. I'm going to teach a few of her students note reading between 6:00 and 7:30pm. There is a conflict with the time. The next day is May 15th, which is fishing opener. I'm planning on going fishing with my friends Matt Yams and Mark Long, who is dead. My dad arrives. I ask him about the opener. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is leaving tomorrow to go to the airport. She may be going to Germany. Grandpa and grandma Redding, my aunt Joanne Redding, my neighbor Alvin Broud, and others arrive. There is a big conflict with time: when I can teach piano, how much time I can spend teaching, who is going fishing on the opener and when, and what about Annie going to the airport?"
"I'm lying in a large upholstered chair; Tom is nearby, and a female (unidentified). I'm shifting around in the chair and the upholstery tears and the seat sinks. I'm frightened, it's as though I'm going to fall into the chair and (drown? hurt myself?)Tom goes for help."
"I dreamt that I had entered a town which had just been taken over by a gang of criminals. Business was going on as usual, but everywhere there were people walking around with machine guns, etc. on their arms. I remember that I went to the barber shop to get a haircut. As I went in I noticed a man out in front who was collecting money, taxes or something of the sort. Everyone who came up to him paid him in coin and called him sir. The man's appearance (personal) was very obscure. I sat down, was conscious of someone alongside of me but couldn't tell who it was. As I was sitting there, a man came in the shop and looked in my direction. He said, ""I thought I saw a couple of faces back there."" As he came back to me I couldn't make out anything about him because of the haze. He put both hands on my face and said, ""You have a professional face."" Then his hands started towards my neck and I had the feeling that he was going to choke me. I took hold of both of his wrists and pushed him away."
A building was being rebuilt. I noticed that the windows were not lined up from the ground floor to the top floor.
"We are visiting Patrick & Margaret: I help pull out the table, as we do at our home. After the meeting, as Margaret leaves, she gives me a long cardboard box with lots of ""stuff"" in it. (Song talked about ""too much stuff."") I hear that Margaret's eldest daughter is divorced, as is the youngest. (not sure) As we leave Patrick waves good-bye in a friendly manner. (Feeling of loss and alienation from the Book Cafe.)"
A man saw me and I was embarrassed again. In both dreams the feces was like a hard ball.
"I was with G. in the South Station. While she stood by, I asked for two tickets to Worcester, received them, and laid down a five-dollar bill. Just then G. declared she would not go with me and I asked the agent to take back one ticket. He said that he could not because he had stamped it. I regretfully kept both. Meantime, I had received as change due me a pair of fur-lined gloves."
"Last night I had kind of an odd dream. I dreamt that I was back at this place that was kind of, it kind of reminded me of like the Wilcox Center auditorium except it had a stage, and the room was kind of dark except for some stage lighting that was kind of bluish and a yellowish-whitish spotlight kind of in the middle of the room. And there was like a dance party going on, except the sound system was kind of low and it wasn't really all that loud. But there was cluddy techno going on, and I was with Astrid and Linda and there were some families and parents and things there. And there were some like bleacher seats, as though we were at my hometown's Jordan Center or something like that. But there was this big open foyer for us to dance around and then there was a stage. And I would be like, I would meet Astrid and Linda around, and then I would leave them with some other people and then I would go mingle around with some other people and then I was going to just dance. And they kind of toned it down a little and they were getting ready to do this show. And what it consisted of was this animal trainer person who was there, and had an alligator that was like almost twice the size of a chichahua dog and he was on a leash and they were walking him around the stage. And all of us people from the Wilcox Center had to line up and walk up on stage and go by and pet the alligator and say something to it.  This is getting so bizarre! And then everybody was suddenly dressed like so nice. Somebody was in this like blue jacket and this black dress and everybody else was in like black dresses, and I couldn't figure out where I was going to be in line and I like wasn't even going to do this show thing. And Randy's yelling at me from the back of the room, ""Jasmine, go to the back of the room."" And then some other volunteers kind of helped me find my place. And before I could get up to the stage to the alligator, I kind of faded into another scene. I was in my studio and Terri was over working on my machine. And I had two monitors because what were supposed to be able to do is work from the PC and the Mac at the same time with the same mouse, but two keyboards and two monitors. And I can't remember what I was doing, but I was doing some kind of a script or something for that show. I was doing the audio and DP and the typing in Word all at once, and Terri was helping me. And then I just faded into consciousness."
"My dream was set in what appeared to be another planet. The coloring was all brown, except for a few neon lights. This place was not familiar to me in real life, but it seemed to be in my dream. My best friend was in the dream - and she was in search of her meaning in life. She was 16 in my dream, as she is now, and her father encouraged her to find this meaning. The only way she could find her purpose was if her father died. He was aware of this but she was not. He tried numerous times to kill himself in subtle ways - but was never successful. Then he realized the only way to die was if the ""mother bird"" killed him. This bird was the queen of this place I think. So my friend was told by her dad that he only had 30 minutes left. The minutes were counted on a bomb-like digital clock. When 30 minutes were up, a giant white bird with neon pink streaks appeared and pointed at him and he exploded like a firework."
"Nice Breasts  I see my friend Persia Miko, who at first seems to be my grade school classmate Rita Bauer. I notice her breasts. They are very beautiful: round and plump, not huge but good-sized. She is wearing a white t-shirt and I see her uplifting bra through it. The bra has prints on it."
"Frank and a woman named ""Cindy"" are going to work on an opera workshop! Frank is waiting by the shore of a lake and Cindy arrives in a big square boat (looks like the Lady of the Lake of Lake Chelan, Wa.) --Church dinner in a garden: a big feast; I see huge amounts of food wrapped in Saran wrap, so it will stay warm; I eat yellow corn, cauliflower, fish steaks and a dessert; later I lick a delicious thick, blue dessert from my fingers one by one. I am sitting next to an old acquaintance from the Book Cafe and I tell him that I remember him and that ""I am married to that tall, grey haired man sitting over there."" He says: ""Oh yes, with pleasure I remember him."" We sit down in the sunshine....."
Peach Deodorant  I find some good smelling peach deodorant and decide to buy some and give it a try. A woman I know is there.
"I was going to a big building. When I went inside, I saw that it was a large store. I was given some things to sell."
"I am seated on a couch with Rochelle. We are on a pile of freshly done laundry, clothes, towels, etc. Rochelle is figuring up something on her calculator. It gets overheated and she tosses it across the room on the floor. She throws herself behind the couch and I sit there and wait. The battery pops out of the calculator and then overheats and burns and smokes. The air is thick with bad smells. I get up and walk outside. It's time to leave now and I get in my red pickup truck and drive over to say goodbye to Dwight (Rock Hudson?). I walk into the house and find him. We then walk out the back side door. I see many cars and hub caps lined up neatly. He says, ""The used car man next door puts them there during the day."" As we walk to the pickup, I remember I didn't take my card he gave me as a farewell. I ask him to go back and get it for me. He does so. I get into the driver's seat of the pickup and see that he has put a store of sugar free snacks in there for me to enjoy on my trip. I am touched. Dwight gets in with the card. I thank him for his thoughtful gift. He smiles. Jake is now in the back seat. He has put a special hand hold on the steering wheel for me to use. I thank him and try to use it. It is uncomfortable. I say, ""I'm sorry but I need it back the way it was."" He apologizes. I say, ""Oh no, I thank you for the thought, but it just isn't working out."" He fixes it. Pink liquid and oil and so on pours into the column of the steering wheel and then he fixes it back the way it was. I suddenly remember I had forgotten my wheelchair, crutches, pills and raised toilet seat back at Rochelle's. I was feeling so good, I just forgot them. I send someone back to get them for me. She returns with it. Several aunts are there with babies to wave me goodbye."
"Theresa is in my living room. She's kind of moved in with her kids. Someone drives an old beat up car to the curb and Theresa laughs and calls it ""Old Paint."" I am in wonder and thankful for her sense of humor. Then I see her kids have painted colorful marks all over my white walls. I am tired and realize I'll have to paint over the walls again. Those kids are like ""wild Indians."" Then Theresa says, ""It's time to do the by-laws."" I say, ""OK, let's go back to the office."" As I start to follow Theresa, a little baby girl gets cranky. She hangs on to me thinking I'm going to desert her again. I sooth her and say, ""See, here's a comfy bed and some toys and I am here with you."" It's a girl's bedroom. I then see another bedroom and I say, ""I'll be right back."" I go in there and look around. I am amazed that there is an entire, complete kitchen in this spacious nice bedroom. I say to Grandma Mildred, ""You should see Aunt Esther's room with a complete kitchen."" I compliment Aunt Esther. Then I remember the baby and I see Dovre at about 12 years old in the bathtub and I ask her to look in on the baby girl. I see she's OK and I ask Dovre to babysit her."
"Bodybuilding Competition  I'm on stage for a bodybuilding competition. I don't flex my muscles really hard when I'm on stage, but I do try to look strong and defined as I walk off the stage."
"I'm looking through a newspaper trying to find a job, and I call the number and within a few minutes I get the job. The job's in a nearby city at a small comic/model store. I'm the only employee there except for the store owner who looks just like Michael Moore. He says that today is the Grand Opening of the store and that we're going to try and get a bunch of steady customers by having a huge sale. We won't tell anyone, but secretly everything is 90% off. If they pay $21.80 on comics, we only charge the $2.18. I try to tell him that that's not a good idea. If we do that, we won't make any money, and not only that, but we'll lose a lot of money. But he won't listen to me. After we finish talking, all the customers start coming through the door. Now I'm behind the counter and I'm ringing up customers, and it's kinda fun for me to tell people that they only have to pay 10 percent of the total. They're always so happy. After everyone is gone, I walk around the store. It's completely empty. I realize that we sell some pretty corny crap, but oh well, it's a job. A certain trade-paperback comic series catches my eye and I start to read. I then realize that I'm totally alone and the owner is nowhere to be seen. As soon as I realize this, the store is packed with many more people than before, but now it's mostly parents. They all seem pretty embarrassed when they come up and ask me where they can find some weird character I've never heard of. One particular guy really pissed me off. He came up to me and asked where he could find this guy that had a whale head. He didn't know the exact name, but he kept saying, ""Whale head, he has a whale head."" I'm finally like, ""Look man, we're really busy and this is my first day. I'm not even sure if we have that,"" instead of understanding and being cool about it. He mutters something under his breath and gives me this really dirty look. I'm thinking WTF and underneath the counter, so he can't see, I give him the bird. But his brother behind me sees me and is like, ""What are you doing?"" and I convince him I used my pointer finger, not the middle one. This seems to do the trick and then he starts asking about whale head man and by this point I've had enough. I look at both brothers straight in the eye and say, ""Get the hell out of my store!"" Then I wake up."
Have a sense of talking to my new friend Jason or maybe asking him something.
"I am swimming across a milky glacier-like lake. My hands and arms are straight and powerful. I am impressed with how easily I am doing this without getting tired or scared. I notice my legs are not moving, so I try and use them too. It is a bit awkward. I get out on the other side. Ernie and Ginny are coming over. I notice I'd better be on my toes and do things right if Ernie is around. I mail a letter. Later, he has a letter to be mailed, but it doesn't have a stamp on it. I help Ginny get a stamp on it."
"I've come to the Business Office for a little visit with Michelle and to bring her a list of some stuff we want to get rid of from the branch. It's actually in the form of a ""catalog"", with pictures stuck to white pages and some kind of ring binder. I'm trying to interest Michelle casually in some of the stuff to keep, but we joke about it. I look at the rest of the office - it's been changed quite a lot by taking down some of the walls, and now Norma & Marilyn can work together easier, everybody moves around, very open. I'm not going to stay long, so I don't want to get into any conversations with any of the others. [Note: the personnel are accurate, and the overall design of the office.] I go down the back hall to the bathroom and chat with some other folks along the way. There's a stray kitty here, and I think I'd better take him along and take care of him - maybe I'll see if Michelle wants him. But I decide to go back by way of the first floor, and when I get around to the front I realize, whoops, probably I shouldn't go across the public area with a cat, I'd better go back to the staff elevators. [This place is looking more like a hotel than a library - flowered carpet, fancy appointments, etc.] At the elevator we have to wait with some other folks for a while, and I examine the cat's stomach. I had noticed earlier a kind of rough spot, thinking it was a sticker or burr stuck to his fur. It's not, though, it's some kind of hard thing that's burrowed into his skin, and the top of it protrudes. Looks like he'll need to have that removed. The elevator comes, and we squeeze in - it has a glass wall, though there's not much to see outside - there's a person next to me, against the back wall, that looks like a homeless person, and smells a bit. He/she says something to me, but he/she looks and sounds rather sinister and I try to ignore it. By the time we get off, the kitty's missing (in the shuffle) and I have to look for it. ------scene shift------- I'm at Hope's house (Hope and her mom, actually) - they're out and I'm house-sitting; I'm stepping outside to look for the cat on the street (it's night now), and I walk up a bit, nearly out of the light from the sliding glass doors, and I see some movement. There's a cat, but not mine, and a man's shape is moving toward me. As he becomes visible, I see (having been nervous) that he's a neighbor - tall, black, greying, a nice man, though taciturn - and we say hello, I tell him what I'm doing. [I'm not sure about the next part, if my cat shows up or not, but I'm trying to get in the door, or let my cat in, and a number of other cats slip in while I have the door open a crack.] He offers to help me get the other cats out, so we go inside. There's a long table laid with food for guests, and some people start to show up and sit down. Some have brought others with them, and pretty soon the place is bustling with chatty people crowding in. I'm very much disconcerted - some of these are very colorful people, like we found them at a carnival. A few biker types, but all quite friendly. What am I going to do with all these people? Hope comes home and is surprised. [Maybe another scene, I'm fiddling with my tooth - the capped one - and convinced it's loose, I actually pull it loose, I'm horrified.]"
"As we started up the cliff, I said, ""Don't take the cliff edge trail but this one further back."" So we did. We came to a room fitted into the rocks and on to others. I said, ""we can sleep here. J. in the room back there and where can the other sleep?"""
"We are visiting people with only a very short time to stay; I yell at Frank: ""Can't you just spend time with me?"" See Jacobs: vague; Sholeses: Ronald explains about Jews in Israel getting worn out standing on their heads. See straw dolls that children made to imitate this. (!)  - I am at a lecture: like a Lenten retreat: I carry a thermos of coffee: share it first with Roxanne K., then with Marissa: she holds out white cup for me to fill; ungrateful."
"This is as close to a recurrent dream as any. I have had this dream maybe twice a year for the last 4 years Ð always a similar dream but slightly different than this one. I wake up in the morning and I am really excited to go surfing. It is sunny and I know the waves must be really good. Friends are waiting for me to pick them up but when I got to get my surfboard, I cannot even find it. I kind of assume that my dad hid it somewhere because he thinks surfing is a waste of time. I look all around the house (my parent's house) and I finally find it. The board is broken in half and is totally unrideable. For some reason I think my dad must have broken it. I am pissed off, but I know it is pointless to ask him about it because there is no such thing as a rational conversation with him. There is nothing I can do, so I just shake my dad and think how fucked up this situation is."
"I was paintballing in a neighborhood.  One of the guys from my boyfriend Jeremy's team was across the street.  Our friend Jake was by a car a ways down from where I was.  We decided on a certain type of game, and I went all out.  I shot a person across the street and I went running down towards Jake.  He said something about being 17 feet away. I got closer and yelled surrender.  He didn't and I tried to back away so I could shoot him.  I ran into the middle of the street and got hit from all sides."
"My brother Stuart committed suicide. I didn't understand why.  Afterwards I was in a sort of cafeteria, talking to my old friend Candy and her mom Dena.  Candy was eating ice cream from a plastic wine glass and speaking to me in Spanish.  I went down to the beach where the suicide had been.  There was a line of men walking by, and one of them suddenly grew to be about twice as big as the others.  I was to figure out why.  There was a demonstration regarding trial air tanks for snorkeling, and somehow this was the cause.  I tried their little air tanks.  It worked at first, but water started to leak in.  I came up after inhaling some water. Then somehow it was like a 'do-over' and Stuart was going to kill himself again.  I talked to him first. He told me that he would leave his life in our (the family's) hands. I told him not to. He was planning to die by some sort of injection. I yelled at him trying to convince him not to. I said, ""If you're dead, then what's the purpose? You wouldn't be able to cuddle Sheila [his girlfriend] anymore..""  His retort was, ""What, feel her up? I'm not completely horny. I'm happy just to be in her presence."" and then he continued on with the attempt. Sure he was leaving his life in our hands.  I was angry.  Something happened with the injection and he bled to death instead.  A little later, I was sitting on a log. He came and sat down next to me. I asked what it was like for him to be dead, if he was happy now.  I guess we had a sort of wake party, with lots of food."
"Last night I dreamed that I was eating at home and I was thirsty, but there wasn't any water. I couldn't stand up to get it and asked for it, but didn't get it. They told me to wait. I continued eating and kept getting thirstier, until I awoke and realized that I was really thirsty."
"The Illuminated Night  I'm in a barrack-like structure. I show a man where his bed is: next to mine. He has a body sheet wrapped around him for a sleeping bag. I have a small trash bin near my bed. The man has a sleeping bag. I'm outside sleeping. It's dark. I awaken. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are there, in sleeping bags. I'm lying down in shallow water in a sleeping bag; the water comes up to my neck . I take big gulps of the water. Tim says he wouldn't drink the water because it's muddy. It's kind of muddy; I drank before I stirred up the mud on the bottom. There is lake to my left, and a bleacher-like area where people have gathered. Police are there. I leave the area I'm in and creep through the bushes on a path that turns towards the people. I see a tennis ball on the ground. I get pinesap on my hand as I walk; it brushed up against a tree. It's a well-lit night: the moon must be out, though I don't see it. I see the Brimson crew team on the lake. My friend Tom Napper is coxing. They row fast. They approach the shore, not slowing, and scrape the boat up onto the rocky beach. The boat they row has two main aluminum hulls, like and elongated pontoon. The Brimson golf team is playing near the shore. My classmate Katie Grendvig hits a drive. I feel like giving a verbal commentary, a play-by-play, of what is happening. I have a good feeling, being out on an illuminated night."
Releasing Fish  I am fishing. I have caught five or six small northern pike. I try to release them. Some of them can't be revived. I know they will die and float on the surface of the water. I think this is okay because birds or turtles will eat them: they won't be wasted.
"I had gone shopping. It was very early morning, still dark outside. First I was at a fabric store. It was a very expansive store with aisle after aisle of fabrics and the perimeters of the store were also lined with fabrics. The fabrics along the walls seemed to reach to the ceiling. There wasn't very much room to walk in the aisles, especially between the walls and the ends of the rows of fabrics. I was riding in something, maybe like the kind of scooter someone who couldn't walk well or far would use. I was having difficulty getting it around corners since the aisles were all so narrow. Someone offered to help once but I told her I was managing. Next I was at a store something like Linens N Things. I was buying several things. I went to pay for my things and the cashier, female, rang them up. One of the things I was buying was a box of dishes that was on sale for $35.96. The box was about 12 inches square and about 5 inches tall. When she gave me the total of my purchases it was a little more than $36 more than it should have been so I told her I thought she had accidentally rung up the dishes twice. She removed a set of dishes from the bill and then handed me a receipt. When I looked at it the dishes weren't on there at all. Then I realized that when she had rung them up they didn't ring up at the sale price. She called the manager to the front of the store. He was not a nice man at all, very rude. He was close to 6 feet tall with thick black hair. I would guess him to be in his mid to late 30's in age. He just looked down at me while I tried to explain what had happened he asked me how often I shop at their store. I was silent for a few seconds, completely surprised that he would ask that. Then I asked him if he was implying that he was only going to take care of this if I was a regular customer. He didn't say anything but I could tell that was the case by the look on his face. I was shocked. Without paying for my things or taking any of them I turned and started to walk out of the store. Just before I walked out the door I stopped, turned around to look at him, and said, I'm not a regular customer any more. Then I left walked out the door. I could tell by the look on his face that he really didn't care that he had just treated a customer like this. My behavior wasn't without room for improvement as I led him to believe that I had been a regular customer when in fact I wasn't. I tried to justify in my head what I had said by thinking that I could have become a regular customer if my first experience there had been better. It is still dark outside and I am walking to my car. There aren't that many cars in the lot because not too many people shop that early in the morning. Most of the cars are in one row, the outermost row for parking. I parked in this row, a little distance from the store, which is typical for me. The parking lot wasn't very well lit and I was having trouble seeing my car. I walked past it twice before I finally saw it. As I driving out I realized they had made changes in the layout of the parking lot to improve traffic flow when I found myself needing to get over to my right to exit the lot. There was a cement wall, or something similar, that was a few feet high, to my left. The change had apparently not been recent because there was nothing around that made it look as though construction was going on. There were quite a few cars exiting so I had to wait for someone to let me go in front of them so I could exit. I was noticing that everyone seemed to be turning right at the exit. I am in another store with one or two friends. We are at the register paying for our purchases. There is another customer standing behind us. I'm telling my friends about what happened to me at the other store. There were somewhat surprised at how the manager treated me but not completely. My friends and the other customer were agreeing that stores just don't seem to treat customers the way they once did. While we're talking I'm watching a receipt come up from one of the grey credit card machines that are common in stores. The female cashier handed it to my friend. We are in the parking lot. It is still dark. None of us have parked near the other. We're parked in a manner that forms a triangle. Both of my friends have the same name, Anna. One of them said something about the three Anna's and suggested we do the same thing we used to do. Our vehicles weren't cars, or perhaps I should say they remind me more of a kind of toy vehicle a parent might buy for their child. We were all in our vehicles and one of my friends said hello in a singing tone. Then the other one said hello in a singing tone an octave higher. Then I did the same, yet another octave higher. This is what the one friend meant when she suggested we do what we used to do. We are going to go someplace else. They are both dressed considerably more casual than I am so I tell them that I want to go home first and change into something more casual and that I'll meet them at the next place. They are concerned about how long it will take me. I try to assure them that it won't take me that long because my home is so close. I live near where my condo was and I just need to go down 96th St a short distance and then turn left. When I entered 96th St I was no longer in my vehicle. I was traveling by my own power but not walking. What I was preparing to do was perfectly common. My friends were concerned because it was so dark. 96th St didn't have any street lighting and no buildings along the street that would offer any light to the street. Besides that, most of the street was lined with trees so as we looked down the street we could see nothing but pitch black darkness. I told them I wasn't concerned because I was so familiar with the street. I was lying on my stomach with my arms stretched out in front of me, in Superman flying position, and skimming the grassy area on the side of the road as I moved forward. I was going about the speed of a bicycle, certainly faster than walking but slower than a car. At first everything was fine. Then a car passed me heading in the same direction that I was. I was a bit unnerved because it was so close to me. I realized that cars couldn't see me there. I tried to get further from the road but there was hardly any room for me to get over because of the trees and a rise in the ground to my right. Two more cars passed me, again heading in the same direction. Now I was becoming downright nervous, afraid I was going to be hit. I reached a point where there was road construction going on. I had to stand up and try to climb over a hill of dirt and rocks. I was looking for things to hold on to as I did so I would fall and hurt myself. But I also didn't want to get dirty. There were one or two male construction workers watching me. I think one made have said something to me related to it being dangerous but I somehow indicated to him that I would be fine. After I got over that one I think I crossed a street and then there was another one that I also navigated successfully."
"I'm on a bus in the morning, got to get school - I'm late. School's just started and I don't want to be late, it's a bad way to start off. I look at my watch and see that I only have 10 minutes to get there - this bus won't do it, we've got to get off. The bus stops, and we're going to walk (or run), but we have to go through this house. For some reason it's the only way to get there. It's not occupied at the moment, I think - at least nobody's home - but there is ""someone"" there. I'm not sure if it's a human. This ""person"" has a riddle or question we have to answer before we can get through the house. It's on a sort of flip-chart that he shows us, lifting up the top page to show what's printed on the next. I feel frustrated, but I know this is the only way so I look at it and try to think. It shouldn't be hard. But we're running out of time."
I was talking to someone and working with the various versions of my resume trying to figure out which one was the right one for whatever purpose we had been discussing.
"I go down a long narrow room to the left to get shoes. And hose to finish dressing. I want to sit down but the long white bench is all covered with bits of cakes of blacking. I look out window and see mother outside, looking sad. She had just been let out of a car and I judge she can't remember which house to enter. I say to R, ""If you don't go and let her, I will."" She says, ""Oh, you go."" But E. who is standing near says, ""No, R. you go, you have your coat right there."" So she goes but mother is now lying down in the snow. I think she looks real glad to see R. and must be saying so. R. helps her up and I ask her if she isn't cold."
"This dream was very confused. It seems I was trying to trick some men (or boy) into admitting whether or not he was a communist. After trying to catch him on several questions, I finally fooled him and he confessed he was a member of the communist party. Here I was a little frightened. Who the man or boy was, what was the setting, or what was the person to me, I do not know."
"My brother Tony and I have a large truck, a refrigerated truck. We were going in on a business deal together. We were half way to Forty Mile Bend when we stopped at a house and met a few of our friends. It started to get late and we decided to stay the night. About 7:00 p.m. we discovered four girls were missing (little girls 2-6 who lived at the house). We found that they were in the back of the truck and the freezer was on. But for some reason we couldn't let them out till morning. We very carefully let the air out of the tires on one side of the truck (reason?). We couldn't let the girls out because it was too dark. Morning came and four of us went in to get them out. The inside of the truck was icy and frosty. The girl I took out was able still to talk and was talking to me as if nothing had happened. All four girls should have been frozen solid. As I talked to the girl I brought out, the more I noticed she was made of stainless steel and didn't have a head. The other three girls were alright."
"It consisted simply of a public figure, who I identify as Lyndon Johnson, and his wife, being received in a street in a reception as any reception would be out in the world. The ticker tape parade, etc. where he and his wife were always stepping out a big presidential or diplomatic limousine and being received by police and dignitaries and throngs of people. I saw this scene anywhere from 3 to 4 times, and it never varied. It was always the same."
I went to see something into a store and to my surprise it was a doctor's office. He was talking to patients of how he restored limbs for them. Then he told me he had put a pin in one of my fingers. It was stiff and he restored its flexibility. I was looking at my fingers and trying to recall the incident but couldn't.
"I was at the high school. I wanted some coffee. I was behind the counter. I wasn't suppose to go there. It was partly like a diner too. It was the teacher's lounge. I snuck back there--there were 3 large coffee pots--all full of fresh brewed coffee. But just then a guy in charge came. I was sitting in the front with some girl friends. I didn't know them. I was trying on team softball shirts. They had slanted bold writing. I tried one on and I couldn't get it off back over my head. It was stuck and I couldn't see. The girls were now lounging provocatively. By the time I got the shirt off all the coffee was gone. I put on some more water and went to the bathroom. The teacher's aide stuck his hand through the window--giving me a tea bag, a pack of creamer and a pack of sweet 'n' low. ""I've already cleaned out the coffee filters and turned the machines off,"" he said. I slapped the tea bag flying out of the window sill and said, ""GODDAMNIT!"" The principal was how making an announcement over the intercom. He said, ""Please bring your old shoes, stools and coats to school tomorrow."" He was suppose to tell about the thrift store exchange project--but the way he said it, nobody knew what he was talking about."
"(11/15/99)[""Investigative reporting.""] I am outdoors. I'd been asked to do a small bit in a video promo about disability. Three of us stand in a row in front of a large standing audience. We each have a letter of the alphabet to mime in a hand gesture. The three letters are COC. I am the second C. I manage to do this even with my deformed hand. After that is over I go inside and ask for any odd jobs they may have. A male editor says yeah. Here's one and hands me a note. I am to call some people to interview them. I try and try to reach one man. He won't answer the phone. He is a war vet and there is some mystery. I am also researching the subject. Pulling files out of the file drawers. I notice newspaper clippings all over the floor and see one. I read it. It is the story of a grandfather that decided to commit suicide. He visits his Grandchildren for a last afternoon together. They are grateful for the time with him. They go bird watching. They see regular Wrens. Then they are lucky enough to see a Super Wren. It is a beauty. As I read this I notice the irony of them enjoying seeing the Super Wren and at the same time he's already decided to die. Seems strange to me. Wouldn't the wonders of life pull him back into life?"

"I'm going to see a movie. I see some chairs downstairs. I follow Juliet down the stairs. The stairs are clogged with coats, large art-type books, and people. I try not to step on the people. We chat as I go by. Then I look for a comfortable chair. I find one in the back. I ask Jock to carry it more forward so I can see better. He does. I find a pitcher of beer in my hand. Someone comments on it as I go by. I notice I don't have glasses. I make a joke and wonder why I have a pitcher (which the person called a vase). After all, I don't drink. Jock has 2 glasses. I say, ""Leave it to you to think of the glasses."" I ask his help in setting up the chair. It's just a bit too big for the small space and tips over the stair edge when I try to sit. I see wheelchair tires next to the stair edge that the feet of my chair are resting on. Jock says, ""You know, I usually hold you back until you get all the facts (when he's giving me a client). I'm a little surprised and annoyed. He then is surprised at me and says, ""I misunderstood you. I thought, you know, you said about alcohol and drugs and those guys you'd pick up on and I thought you didn't like people like that and wouldn't be good at helping them, so I didn't send any of them to you."" I am surprised. [BL]"
"I was looking at a mouse with a crowd of people around me. The people seemed familiar to me, but don't exist in real life. We were trying to figure out what to do with the mouse or where I should put it. I suggested my hamster cage. A woman in the group said, ""No, the mouse will never fit."" I argued, ""Yes it will,"" and I put the mouse in the cage. Then a problem occurred when I saw my hamster. I was afraid that the mouse and hamster would fight and my hamster would be killed. The hamster was in the first compartment of the cage and hadn't seen the mouse yet, but was moving to the part of the cage where the mouse was. I got the mouse out before anything happened to it."
"I am asleep in the same bed with Bonnie at 3:00 a.m. Mateo comes in and wakes me. ""I want to take a bath,"" he says. I tell him it's 3 a.m. I get up, get my doctor's bag and go to another cabin. We are on a cruise ship. A man and a woman are sharing a cabin. They aren't supposed to, but everyone just looks the other way. He has bumps all over him and I tell him he has the mumps or maybe the measles and he can't continue the trip. It'll take three weeks to heal up."
"(03/04/01)[""I can walk now.""] I am in a wheelchair at perhaps a University. Friendly people and I are going from one building to another. Lots of stairs everywhere and no ramps. I drive my wheelchair up a short flight of cement stairs. I make it, quite surprised that I did. And pleased. I then see the left wheel is frayed and damaged, coming apart. I look down a long flight of stairs. Too long to drive the chair down. I see another back flight of stairs made of wood and flatter longer steps, more gradual. I decide the chair won't work anymore and decide I will attempt to sit on my butt and scoot down step by step. A woman stands at my left and I stand out of the chair and balance, leaning on her arm for support. Then I take a step and successfully manage the first step. I try a second step and one by one I successfully walk down the full flight of stairs. I am ecstatic. I can walk now. A male professor, friendly is in the background somewhere."
"Ramona's Insurance  My sister Ramona's automobile insurance is twice as high as mine. At first I didn't' realize this. We both pay $542. I pay this much every year, while she pays this every six months."
I was with Matthew standing at a register in a store. He was standing to my right. Eight or nine times someone came up and stood to Matthew's right. Each time it was an actor. Matthew would nudge me and point out who it was. One time it was Robert Uhlrich. I haven't seen him act in a few years but I used to think he was very handsome and hearing about some of his community work representing some illness I've also respected that work. I introduced myself to him and told him it was quite a pleasure to meet him that I've been a fan.
"After coming into work at Basch Jewelers, I went downstairs to leave my coat and books. On the way up the steps to the office I passed a girl who was going down. Just after the girl passed, I realized it was Millie, a high school girl who worked part time. I was quite surprised because she had been out sick for the past two weeks. After greeting her, surprisedly I noticed she looked rather pale from her illness."
I returned to a spot where I had had a thought in order to recall it.
"I am a SERVANT in a large household: Father Andrew comes as a guest. I have to serve him coffee and cookies. He is nervous and sits at a table. I forget to bring him a spoon. I also have to put away the candles. There are many rooms, tables - them move to a different house: Father Andrew comes to visit us; I loan some girls some soap."
"I don't remember where I was, but what I do remember is that there were some little kids hiding underneath some little benches. I lifted two of those benches and let the children be free. There was a man who had put them there. I don't remember any more."
"I went to visit Terry D. He and his wife lived in the country, but I don't know what town. I was talking to him but I was also outside with his wife, talking to her while she hung laundry on the clothesline. Primarily what I noticed her hanging was underwear. It didn't really bother me but I thought Terry might be embarrassed by that. Later we were in their town. He and some other woman were showing me around town. They had all of these underground passages, where you could walk around town and be safe from the elements. You wouldn't have to be cold or hot or get wet or anything. We were talking about the pros and cons of that versus walking around outdoors. Carriage rides wouldn't be as much fun there. But it was nice not to have to deal with very cold weather. It was as though all four sides of these passages were all brick. but a finished brick that was very smooth to the touch and very pretty colors. Yellow is the color I remember. They weren't just straight walkways. Some of them curved and some were hilly, for lack of a better word. I was with Bob F and we had these little cars on a sort of map. We were racing our cars and the map or path was very windy and such. These little cars had things sticking out from the bottom, similar to toy racecars my brothers had when they were younger. This map had a track. I was automatically going to win because I was in front of his four cars. It was just one lane. We also said something about his four sons."
"I remember having to rehearse for some play. Then, all of a sudden it's time for production, and I see that Mr. Dell and some girl I don't know are the stars (in this Shakespeare play I've never heard of). This was really very funny, although it didn't sound much like Shakespeare. Mr. Dell knew all his lines perfectly. He was very confident, like Laurence Olivier. He was good and he knew he was good. You could tell he was acting because nobody in real life puts so much enthusiasm into anything. Then came a scene where he was talking about Europe, and Hawaii, and travelling, and everything in a normal Dell voice and in a way that epitomized how a Mr. Dell should act, as if the part was created for him. I was laughing at this characterization of Mr. Dell, and my whole family was also laughing (although they really don't know him well enough to think something like that was funny). Next, I remember riding a small vehicle, maybe a golf cart, but more like a mix between a bicycle and an automobile. I think I'm in a school parking lot, and I have the gas down all the way (driving fast is so fun in dreams) and there are cars I almost hit, but manage to get around every time. I can't say how fun that was! Then I stop, in the doorway of the school, and at this point the vehicle looks just like a bicycle (that's why I was confused). Mrs. Saint is there."

"Three friends of mine-I can't remember who they are-are discussing our basketball plans with me.  They want to know if I would rather play during the day then in the evening after work.  I tell them that for me, that would be much better; I'm not sure why.  I know I mentioned that it would be easier to find a court free then.  I tell them that if I were working, I could not play during the day, because I would get too sweaty, and it would take me a long time to have a shower and get cooled off to start working again."
"We were in Florida. I was on the beach. There was sand all over. There were battles on the beach, shooting at one another. We hid behind a wall and the other guys were shooting holes in the wall. I went on the shore and I put my feet into the ocean water and said, ""Now I can say I was in the ocean water."" Then I had a feeling. I took a dive deep and then started to swim for the top. I was going fast and was holding my breath. I saw the rattlers of a big rattle snake in a pool of water. I got a stick and I saw the big rattler's head sticking out of a hole. I started hitting away at his head. He moved slowly and his head pulled into the hole, but the stick was bent and pointed, so I kept on hitting him with the point. Later I saw him again and he was supposed to be a pet. I came close to him and he didn't go for me. I went into one of the buildings on the beach and the windows were closed and there was air conditioning. I said, ""That's nice when it is too hot."" Then I was in Florida again. I was flying and Otto was so tall, he must have been about 20 ft. tall. He reached me before I could fly higher. I looked in the paper and I saw Flying wave. I am not quite sure it was wave. It was in the last race 1 p.p. I said it was at Tropical Park and I said, ""I can go to the track and play it."" I had a woman in the house. I was going to intimate her. I had a hard-on. I called her into the next room and was going to do it to her just as someone knocked on the door and my sister Mary walked in."
"I am in an office in the town next to the town I grew up in. Everyone is taking a rest. I have to go to the bathroom, but there is no toilet so I use an empty can. I dump the can in the toilet (which is now there)."
"I was in an unfamiliar but pretty place. I was accompanied by two friends, Raul and Isaac. Freddie, my ex-boyfriend, had told Raul that he wanted to start a fight, but Raul had told him that that wasn't nice. Freddie had wanted to fight with him, because he felt in love with me and couldn't stand seeing me always accompanied by Isaac. Then I awoke."
I was helping someone organize their office. I had divided all of their paperwork into three piles. One was ready to file. One was trash. The other was things I didn't know what to do with. I had highlighted the boxes or something of the ones I didn't know what to do with.
"(2004-05-31) I was staying in some relative's house, and was supposed to sleep on a couch.  Daddy had been sleeping there, but he was going to sleep upstairs.  There was a Playboy magazine on the couch, and some other men's magazines, maybe all Playboy.  I wondered if they belonged to Daddy.  But then some vendor at a kiosk asked me if an outline map of the U.S., which had been cut from a black Playboy cover, belonged to me, I (or someone else) responded no, it belonged to Jude Law, who then appeared and claimed it.  When I came back to the house, a lot of other guys were there and were also going to spend the night at the house, so I lost my spot on the couch.  I don't remember what the final sleeping arrangements were."
"I saw Tel or Tol $157. We were watching movies of how hunters get killed hunting big game. We saw a man wound a big doe deer. The doe charged, the man ran. Then we saw the doe. Its head was blood-smeared from killing the hunter. We saw that on three occasions and the deer always faced Judy on the front of the seats. I told her to come back with me. I was afraid the deer would charge her."
"My granddaughter was only about 4 days old and she got into an airplane and flew it, then crashed and didn't get hurt. She became  wise. She talked and said in front of her mother that she loved Grandpa more than anyone else. We were very friendly and I loved her. There was a reporter came over and wanted to get the story from me to put into the paper."
"Bike Ride into Perkins  I ride a bike into a Perkins restaurant. I dodge a table and brush up against a lady on the end. I stop my bike in a corner of the restaurant. There are many people from my high school, a year younger than I, that are there. As I get off my bike they notice my short hair. We joke and engage in small talk. I say that I have to go talk to Annie. I walk down a little ramp and over to a booth where my girlfriend Annie, friends Nelson Eastman, Simon Naver, and others are. I shake Nelson and Simon's hand, asking how its' going. Then I slide into the booth, which is a semicircle, and sit next to Annie. I kiss her and she kisses me. I feel awkward kissing her in front of everyone. She starts kissing and licking on my left ear. It feels good. I kiss her neck and mouth. We pause; I think I should order food. The waitress hands us menus. Everyone orders, I am last. I can't decide what to get, and then think that I want the Blockbuster. I turn to the menu page on the menu where it is, but see that when you order it you get a hamburger, not pancakes, eggs, and hash browns. I see that and don't want it. I think I may have ordered the breakfast blockbuster, but I don't know."
"I was in an apartment building and I hinted something to my boss that I might quit Fuller Brush. He said nothing, but went down to the patio and started talking with two other Fuller men, one of them the branch manager, and the other a German. When I came in, the German began talking about quitting and the others tried to get him not to. They showed him how much money he was making, etc., and how foolish it would be to quit. Then they turned to me to ask if I didn't agree with all this. I said I did, and then he asked me why I wanted to quit. The little act they had been putting on was just to show me how foolish I would be if I did quit. I said I wouldn't quit until I was not making any money or my school work was hurt. They said okay. But then the manager began talking about my sales record. He said he wanted to see more than the $65 I turned in last week. I really turned in over a $100, but my boss needed some of it to fill his quota. At this point I walked away, but I heard my boss saying that I had worked for him and earned another $50. This seemed to satisfy the men."
"I remember an unknown person making a statement that dreams travel from East to West, and I thought this was rather ridiculous, and I made a comeback saying this isn't necessarily true at all. It depends on where you are apt to be standing at the time."
"Bad Timing Sickness  I am sick. I feel my neck and my glands are swollen and tender. I feel terrible. I had just been healthy, and now I'm sick. This is really bad timing for sickness because I want to play sports. I want to try out for football."
"A Tequila Keg  There is a keg party. My friend Niles Zelling is involved, and he may buy the kegs. Something happens with Mickey Mantle. Something happens with a woman fighter, and the Simpson's Oscar night. There is a keg of Rolling Rock beer and a keg of tequila. The keg of Rolling Rock costs $150. I seem to be in a town, and may be driving. It is dark."
"It was near Halloween.  There were drag races around the house.  Every time it was a new set of vehicles.  Motorcycles, AC Transit busses, and so on.  I sat ready to pick up the phone at the sound of a crash.  It was like several dreams were taking place at once, with scene cutaways.  There was 'old Mrs. Heniwick', an acting teacher.  We were balancing Popsicle roadblocks on a truck, as if they were Legos.  The scene reverted to the races.  I had several friends over.  The house was set for a party; the dining room table was pushed to the wall.  A friend stood there, me in front of the pantry door.  Beside my friend formed a being; Death.  He was not completely solid, but made up of a thick black mist.  I looked towards it and the form changed.  He dropped from about 6 feet tall to about 4 feet, and he grew wider.  His ruddy eyes became visible.  A deep, doubled, growling voice rumbled, ""I have come for YOU!"" and the thick black mist descended heavily upon me. I was afraid, but I didn't want the fear to overcome me and cause a panic; I figured that would only make being consumed more painful.  I didn't resist and dropped to the floor.  I was surrounded by the black mist.  The mist was heavy and as I inhaled, my throat constricted and I couldn't really breathe.  I was on my stomach, yet slowly spinning.  My last thought was of a discussion earlier in the night, and I was not above suspecting the whole thing was a trick.  I moved my left arm to cover my stomach from a potential tickle attack.  The spinning yellow linoleum of the kitchen floor dizzily faded out, and I awoke back in ""Mrs. Heniwick's"" classroom.  Some of the classmates were concerned.  Some thought I fainted, yet others applauded me for my 'performance'.  I was happy.  My last thoughts in death were ""okay, I guess I'll see what it is.""  I went to Mrs. Heniwick for a hug, but she is a little odd, and strict, and refuses me.  I looked to the rear of the room.  There were only 12-15 students, each standing on uniformly spaced platforms, perhaps as a step-aerobics class might be laid out.  I saw my online friend Eric.  I called out to him.  'Eric!  We were right.  Look, I'm reincarnated!'  I look to him for my hug, and he supplies it.  I was reincarnated into my own body.  My dad appeared somewhere in the classroom and he hugged me as well.  I awoke with a great sense of comfort, knowledge, and thrill from the experience of death."
Somehow related to conference. Helping someone to buy a suit  and tie. The suit is navy blue pin-stripe. The tie is also blue with a pattern of some kind in it. I asked someone if a beige or tan shirt with go with it or if they needed to wear a shade of blue instead.
"(03/20/01)[""Demasking loving tom.""] A man in his mid 30's maybe is dressed in a fancy suit sort of like a tux. He wears an odd smooth mask that covers his face like the blue men of IBM commercial or like Jim Carrey in The Mask, a movie. He and I begin to come closer to make love. We lie down on a bed and we kiss sensuously. It feels wonderful. The mask disappears. I begin to take off his clothes. I am sexually excited. I am on top. It is a tender and erotic experience. I sit up and he unbuttons my white shirt. We are naked and begin the process of guiding his penis in. It feels wonderful."
"500 Poker  I'm playing cards with my brother Wally and sister Ramona. We're on the hill of 2nd Street. We're waiting. We're playing 2-handed 500. There are three of us; I'm a partner with Ramona. I look at my cards. I almost have a straight flush in low spades. I bid nine spades. I get the joker, an ace, and a low spade in the kitty. I have a straight flush, then, luckily. There are two of some cards. I lead the joker, and draw out two low spades. I then lead a low spade. Wally plays the left bower, and Ramona plays the right bower. Ramona then takes the lead in an off suit. I play the ace of that suit, and Wally trumps it. He is short-suited. Wally has the next remaining highest trump, including the ace and king of spades. I have low trump, but they won't take tricks in this case. Wally sets us, because I don't have high enough trump, even though I have lots of low trump. We switch partners: I'm going to play against them. It seems to be spring, and we seem to be waiting for someone or something."
"The dream of today was similar to that of yesterday, except for the fact that the two girls that I am going with appeared. I was between them, though far away. (I must note that I am having a problem and it is that I don't know with which to stay, because I love them both the same.) Then one of them started to call me, but I didn't know which one it was. Then I continued looking at the sky and so I fell asleep, in the dream, that is."
"See Eric arrive from a trip and come to our house: He walks to the door and no one notices him as he is still sleepy. He leans on the door post and kisses it a long time. Everyone laughs. Eric is embarrassed and he runs to his home--to bed. I follow him and lie next to him and comfort him. ""Please forgive us; how could we do this to you?"" He finally stops crying and he gets dressed to go out. I dress and go down and wait for him in the street. I see him wearing a white trench coat with a sword (like a knight). I follow him and hear him talk with Frank at a PTA meeting, with guitar playing girls I have to take over the meeting. I am invited to the Browns for dinner: good food, but much confusion. Riding a bicycle down a very steep hill, over stumps and bushes. I fall off, screaming, but not hurt."
"I was in the town where I grew up, but my present age, on a screened porch my father slept on. Outside the window, two girls, strangers to me, about 16 years old, played this game: ""This is the way my boyfriend kisses me,"" and one girl kissed the other. ""This is the way my boyfriend squeezes my breasts,"" and the other girl squeezed ... many giggles from both. ""This is the way my boyfriend humps me."" My father is standing beside the bed, my mother in it suddenly; he is bashful about sex."
"Tony S and Dorothy S had twins and I was telling people that they had just had twins. They named one of them Melody and the other something like Delemy or Demily. The second was something I had never heard before and thought it was very odd. There was another reason that I questioned their choice of names but now I can't explain what it was. Maybe because I thought they were too similar. Later I realized that they had quadruplets, not twins. I had a picture of them with the four babies. I was running around showing the picture to members of my family and saying over and over, Tony S and Dorothy S had four babies. I immediately thought that I really needed to go see them now. But I also don't want to go see them while I am still unemployed."
"I am working for this very good-looking guy. The office is a mess. Piles of things are on the desk. I am trying to straighten it out and can't figure out where to put things. I pick up a poster and hang it on the wall. My boss stands close to me and as he is talking, I am aware of how attracted I am to him. I wonder how I can get his attention so he'll like me and find me attractive. He says, ""That's a poster of Tony and someone is coming to the office that doesn't like Tony."" I say, ""Uh oh! Guess it was a mistake to put the poster up."" He and I walk down some stairs. We start to walk through a cafe, but it is closed. Then we walk through the college bookstore to find the rest of the stairs. We continue our walk. We are now more like a couple. He wants some sunglasses and sees some on the side of the path. He chooses one that belonged to the S children. Somehow that was OK because the glasses came from descendants of Darryl."
"I had a semi-bizarre dream last night. I dreamt that I was making a CD for somebody and I was in my room and it was nighttime and it was dark and the LED for my sound system shone brighter than the sun. And my porcelain dolls were like I had tons of them and they all had little spotlights on them that were mounted on the edges of the shelves and that were so neat. And there was this orange spotlight on my sound equipment and this doll of Celine Dion that was sitting in like a teacup on top of my sound CD burner, and the body was like a small baby doll, but the head was like not in proportion. The head was like the head of like Celine Dion's age, and it had her hair and everything. And I took the doll out of the teacup and then I realized I was making the ""Falling Into You"" CD, recopying it, and I had the doll on my lap and the doll was much bigger. Again, the body was like a baby doll and the limbs got a little bit longer, but the head was like of Celine Dion's age and it looked just like her. And somehow I had the notion that in order to move forward and backward on the CD, I had to like squeeze her hand, one or the other, to go forward or backward like instead of the skip buttons on the unit. And it was totally bizarre, and before I knew it, this doll was talking to me and stuff.  Hmmmm, that was weird. Maybe it was because we were looking through my mother's dolls and stuff, and we saw her Corky doll that was like gay."
"I was in a house. It was a beautiful, large home with expensive furnishings. I went to the kitchen where I saw some people whom I couldn't quite recognize. I saw 4 dogs, one of which was a collie. I also saw a small girl, an acquaintance of mine. I then found myself in the basement where I was watching my husband (24) and brother playing pinochle. My brother (24) took the hand, but somehow my husband won money."
I was telling someone that spirit is more important than matter.
"They were going to take the plane on Friday, looking at the schedule. I said, ""we'll have to go then too because there are planes only twice a week."" Miss W. said, ""You can take one from __.The girls will help you take your things over."" Then R. was introducing me to two ladies and the third said, ""you know Mrs. Taylor"", but I didn't recognize any of them. Tried to get R. decide which day and plane we should take."
"I am going somewhere, and have walked some distance toward another town when I realize that I have left my car behind and could be driving."
"I was with a group of friends (I don't know which ones) in a small room, like waiting for something. At a given moment we took each other by the hand and we started to walk down a corridor. The light was yellow and it was hot."
"I hear the guitar class starting and I pick up my guitar and a chair and go in, trying to be quiet because I'm late. G is playing and I try to follow along. I look at the strings and wonder how I'll manage with my arthritic hands. I sing along. The music is beautiful."
"I'm stuck at a petrol station without a car or any money. The station owner also runs a convenience store and an off license. It is evidently very popular - there's a massive queue to get beer and groceries. I queue up to buy a bottle of wine for a party (forgetting I had no money). For some reason I never leave that place - perhaps the party didn't happen, or perhaps it happened there. In any case, now it's the next day and I can't get home. The owner, who reminds me of a London Cabbie, lends me a car to get home. But first I must fill out various papers. He's not just lending it to me for nothing - he's hiring it to me. I end up at a family gathering in a hotel. My mother is there, worrying about the cost of hiring the car, and getting stressed out about it on my behalf."
"I was talking with a man whom I at first mistook for a doctor, but later saw was a judge. He was trying my case. I told him I was sorry about committing the offense."
"We are in Grandpa's car.  Grandpa is driving.  We strike and kill five different people.  I remember the last one well, because I saw a group of children in the road in the middle of the road-a pair of twins and another child, all about 4 years old.  Grandpa tried to straddle them with the wheels  When I looked back, amazingly he had done so with the twins, but the single boy had apparently raised his head while the car was going over him and was struck by something under the car.  When I looked back, the twins were standing over his body.  We ended up at Uncle Jack's, in a house similar to the one at 606 South Wilson."
"My mother is either drunk or crazy. She looks drunk. She lisps, ""Look now at how I created this."""
"I have fallen out of the sky, perhaps an airplane, and am lost up in the mountains in the deep snow. I feel like giving up. It's too much to imagine I can make it back down the mountain. Then I realize I must try. I crawl and struggle. Someone else is in a house trying to watch TV. She has a movie on one channel and another movie comes on. It is confusing. By the time I come down off the mountain, I have an injured leg. [BL]"
"I don't remember the start of the dream...it may have been connected in the following dream somehow.  I went to Myst, and down into the large elevator tree.  I couldn't find the button to send it back up, but there was a wire hanging out.  I touched the two ends of the wire and that activated it, so it started going back up.  I got out at ground level, but there was a little glow of white between the two wires when I got out.  Several moves upwards and the elevator exploded.  I guess I died...the dream was a 'redo'.  This time on the way back up, I touched the wires to my tongue to 'extinguish' the glow that caused the spark and the explosion.  I got out and went towards my car, and I found my 7th grade PE teacher to be following me.  We tried to open the car.  The keys looked like wire, not regular car keys."
I was working Dill's. I received a letter from White's to come back to work. I went to see Benny Meader. I had some paper in one hand and a pencil in the other hand. I told Benny that I would have to reject his offer. He was surprised because he was almost sure that I was going to take it. Andy Palader and he was courteous to them. The young lady was going to college. I was concerned about the job at White's.
"(10/28/97)[""Dancing like mad.""]  I am dressed in my sexy hot pink dress at a dance. No one else is dancing but a woman, Marilyn, from work, comes over and asks me to dance with her. She pulls me up out of the chair by the arm. I start dancing. We do exaggerated moves, going into the adjoining room, where many men are standing around talking. They laugh with us as we gaily dance around and through them. In the first room, I see they are gearing up to dance some ballroom type dancing, like the waltz and the tango. I want to join them and learn those dances, but Marilyn wants to continue our odd dance. We do. Someone comments that our style is silly. Marilyn (now Lucy) has too much arm movement and I do too much leg movement."
"I was watching my brother Steve and Mary taking care of Judy. They were on the front porch in Rivertown. I was standing on the street. Mary came by with a lady friend and they were passing me without recognizing me. I spoke up and Mary then stopped and we talked. Andy P. came by in a boat which ran on the street. He was piloting it along. I was in Rivertown walking down the street and there were a lot of dogs. Then I came to a field and there were bulls. One was very big. I flew by him. Then I came by Walter Luzina. He got kind of tough with me. He was a leader of a gang. He roughed me up a little and then said, ""Now punch me. He held still and I was punching him on the chin. He would get a little dazed, but didn't drop. I must have punched him about ten times. Then something else happened. I had a knife and I'm not sure what happened, whether he tried to stab me and I took the knife from him. I think I killed him, then I broke the knife blade and I took off in flight so I wouldn't get charged for murder."
"I am with a boy who was a childhood friend. We go to the Comfort Inn. We go in the wrong room and go to sleep in someone else's bed. I wake up and realize it and hurry to go. I am worried that I haven't called my parents. As I am getting ready to go to the right room the owners (two men) come in and are very upset. Someone holds me high over their head and takes a picture, laughing about the room mistake. I call someone later and tell them I went to a motel with a man and relate the story and neglect to say it was a dream. I am wearing leggings and a dress and I look really stupid in the picture."
"I am Buffy St. Marie, and Frank Sinatra comes by and likes me. We kiss. He's concerned that he's too old for me, but I assure him I like him just fine. We go to my mother's house. She pulls strands of beads (Indian Wampum beads) off a peg and gathers them up for my dowry. I notice she's not bringing them all and we insist she bring the full dowry. She does not approve the marriage and doesn't like me, but she reluctantly complies."
"A friend was going to Germany and my aunt was very interested in obtaining some original figurines from Germany. Shortly after this friend left for her journey abroad, my aunt and uncle went to New York and my aunt was so afraid that she would not get her figurines that my uncle wanted to go to Germany and get them for her, but my aunt was worried that they would not have enough clothes for such a long trip."
"I am on a beach and the children are going to swim in the water. I see big slabs of rock out in the water. I decide to go swimming with them. I go in, fully clothed, including my jacket. I wade around and see a bald baby, its bonnet down on its neck. I play with him, floating him around in the water. I had told the children I wasn't going out deep, because I didn't want to get my jacket wet, but when playing with the baby, I lie down in the water and get soaked. The water is cold."
"I was living in a log cabin in the north woods with two boyfriends of mine. We were up there deer hunting. One afternoon while we were cleaning a deer that one of my friends had shot in the morning we smelled smoke and looked up the moutainside to see a small forest fire starting. The cabin had Indian pump guns in it for fires that might start around camp. So Don and I took the two guns and got our horses and started for the fire while Chuck rode for help to the Forest Rangers. When we reached the fire it was getting pretty well out of hand but we held it down so it would spread not too much further, and thought we had things pretty well under control. Then a strong wind got behind the fire and we had to get out and join the rangers who were coming to help us when they saw what happened. They started a back fire and soon the fire was out."
"Bill C had called and asked me to come to the office to help Jennifer C with some boxes she was preparing for shipment. I was quite irritated by this, yet I went anyway. When I arrived they had a dozen or so rectangular medium-size boxes sitting in the lobby. They were all full but just needed to be sealed, labeled, and delivered somewhere for shipping. This is why Bill C had called me. I was even more irritated now, not knowing why he asked me to come and do this. Jennifer C brought me one of the labels. She was making the labels, one at a time. She didn't bring me the shipping tape or anything else. They had another woman working in the office helping Jennifer C. I just kept getting more and more irritated by the whole situation. I have no idea why I agreed to do this or why I stayed. Bill C asked me to go into his office to talk with him. It looked different than in waking life as it was larger and had room for people to sit across the desk from him and at one end of the desk. I sat down in the chair at the end of the desk, knowing the psychology of having the desk between us. Our conversation was casual, and a bit awkward. I got the distinct impression that things were not going well for Bill C and that he regretted letting me go. It was as if he realized bringing Bryan N back and letting me go just made things worse instead of better. He seemed to be leading up to asking me about some type of part-time work arrangement. I got the impression that he was thinking about project based and possibly me working from home. I wasn't sure how I felt about this or if I would agree to such a thing. I thought to myself that I would just have to tell him no, that it would not be a good idea. There was more to this out in the lobby, with other people, and with the boxes, but I'm having trouble sorting it out. I was wondering how I would get all of these boxes out to my car, and in to a shipping facility. There was something about moving the boxes around in the lobby. I think I just decided not to help and I was just going to leave but Bill C convinced me otherwise."
"I am in a garage, having my car worked on - something to do with the wheels, or rotating the tires. I'm chatting with the mechanics, I've seen them before, though not to work on my car, I think. We're casual friends, and this is a friendly sort of little neighborhood garage. The burlier guy says it'll be $89.95 to do the work. I roll my eyes and say, fine, ok, at least it isn't any more than that, all the other work I've had done lately has been a lot more, this isn't so bad. I'm feeling pretty lively, strutting around in my new black motorcycle boots and jeans. The other mechanic is noticing, and points at my boots to the other one, a sort of elbow-in-the-ribs look. I think I look spiffy."
"Wally Slept Next To Annie  I'm at Lake Jefferson in Wilmerton playing pool with my brother Wally and others. The pool table is on the north/northeast side of the lake, about where the stream flows in. I see the Thomas family arrive in the distance: Bill, Tamara, Tina, Jessica, and a female I think is my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, but then realize she is Tina's friend. Jessica walks up to the pool table. I don't say anything to her, putting on my ""cool"" persona. She talks to Wally mostly, and some to me. She says that Annie and Wally slept next to each other from the 23rd to the 29th. I know that Wally wouldn't double-cross me: he wouldn't do anything sexual with Annie, so I'm not worried about it."
"Now I come out of my house. I see a girl (Mexican) named Maria who is burrowing herself into the sand. She lives in a foster home nearby. I go to her. I can only see her face as the rest of her is buried in the sand. I try to speak in Spanish, but switch to English because she's losing interest and will disappear if I don't make myself clear. I invite her to visit my house, explaining that she can watch soap operas on TV (we could hear them from the house). She agrees reluctantly and follows me into the house. I am wearing a wedding ring, two of them. One is a store demo that has two words written on it. Bonnie is in the house."
"In this one I was in a rather large, unfamiliar place that looked somewhat like the portals at San Martin Square (Lima). Instead of sidewalks and roads, it was some sort of a yard that was next to a wall (something like a seawalk), but this place was not by the sea. I was with a bunch of guys, around my age, and I started to think that I was the only woman in the place, and at that moment a bus that picked up people who worked in a nightclub passed by. This called our attention and we were asking each other questions. In spite of being surrounded by so many people, I felt lonely. At this point I turned around and saw a group of three girls, among whom there was a friend who went to school with me (she sat next to me in school and we formed a quartet which we called ARAB from the initials of the four names; it's the best way to describe her). When we started to talk, I remembered that she had relatives in Chimbote and I asked her if her family was alright, if nothing had happened to them in the May 31st earthquake which affected that zone. She told me that two of her brothers had died. Then she laughed and said it was a lie, and I was so relieved! I also asked her about her brother (older than she) whom we used to tease when she wrote letters to him in school. She told me he was alright and that he always remembered the quartet that teased him. I don't know how I got away from them and I became like a child in my behavior. I wanted to play, jump, laugh, because I felt lonely and bored. I could see the group of boys doing their thing on one side and the girls on the other. Then they started to come toward me one by one because they were also bored. I had tried to call their attention. We started to look at the stores and then we saw a group of foreign sailors and we thought we would introduce ourselves to them and did so. They were either North American or English (one of these, and it seems they were North American). They only spoke English; none of them knew Spanish. One of the girls who knew English started to translate what they and we were saying. Since I didn't understand anything in English, because I always studied French, I felt kind of strange and kept getting more bored. The girl who knew English had graduated from a British school which is near my home and her parents are North American. I know several girls from that school and know that they come out speaking English perfectly, but I don't remember this girl. Truthfully, she wasn't one of the ones I know. That was all of my dream, because I awoke at that moment."
"(09/11/99)[""As she died, he wouldn't touch her.""] A man, like Jackie Gleason, is married to a woman. She died, and there is a sense of secret about it. I and my three sisters try to find out the secret. Finally, we figure it out. He was with her at the moment of death and he stood there and would not even touch her, much less hug her or be with her as she died. We are shocked and disgusted."
J--- (engaged to M 22) and I were on our way E--- Beach but first we had to meet several women (F 60-70). These older women were sitting on a sofa with their heads cut off. We went up some stairs and got into a roller coaster car. The tracks were covered with small fire crackers which started to go off when we came to the end of the ride. We got back in the car and some-one called to us and asked us to take a boy we had never seen before to the doctor. Several other young people (20-25) got into the car and I woke up. Interpretation The women with their heads cut off probably gained entrance into my dream by the plate in my art book of the statue of the three fates. The fire crackers at E--- Beach came from my memory of the times my parents used to take me there on the Fourth of July. The young people were probably just the wish to meet more young people. Answers to questions 2. I was afraid of the older women but excited at the park and happy with the other kids.3. Actual participant4. Pleasant5. Our living room. E--- Beach and the car.6. No7. No
"I was at a dinner party. As we rose from the table a girl came to me, asking if I remembered her. I didn't but pretended to. We talked of former happenings and I walked with her diagonally across the green lawn. She asked where I was taking her and I said ""Oh, I'll take you back"" and we walked back to the crowd. They were going to the country club for bridge, but I was not asked to that part of the party. I reasoned that it was because they were all men. I wondered through the club grounds looking for someone with whom to play bridge but it was a man's club. I returned to the lanai and found the rest hadn't gone yet so I looked for mother. Found her going to an outdoor toilet. Ask why not seek accommodations inside but she said there were none. Someone told me she was sorry I had to go to star and couldn't go with them. It was raining. An earlier dream was about a job my husband had gotten for us both. It was some sort of chemical research for him. My job was not clear. I thought it was probably clerical or statistical. We were in a laboratory setting up an experiment. Watched gas forming and small explosions in a test tube. I told others I knew nothing of chemistry. They would have tom check. Then some gas escaped. The room was filled with strong fumes and purplish puffs of gas. (Iodine such as did escape in a class of my undergraduate days.) My head ached. I went to open windows. J. Dun came to help. I sat down , in entry by window to recover..."
"I climb aboard a bus, a long luxurious travel cruiser, and look for the most comfortable seat. Find one with a long space in front for legs and I flop down. No one else seems to be coming aboard. I then hear a noise and note we are parked near a railroad track and a train--a long freight train of yellow fruit cars--is coming around the curve of tracks and the curve is so arched that the bus can be hit. Then it is jarred by the roaring train and the upper outside corner near track is smashed by train. But this doesn't bother me. I remain comfortably seated and waiting as damaged bus remains in position."
"I was standing with my family (mother & father, ages 45 and sister, age 22) and several other unknown people by the runway of an airfield. We watched a very large airplane take off. The crewmen were sitting on the wings and not until the plane had taken off from the ground did they begin to crawl into the plane in single file. It seemed very dangerous. The plane did many loops and turns in the air and I was afraid it would crash. Then there were many miniatures of this large plane which would dive into the ground and then bounce back up into the air. Next a group of jet planes flew by. One of them crashed by my sister.

"Brother Steve (deceased) and I went to Uniontown to see Seventick and his wife. He is (deceased). I was brushing off dust off the easy chair. They moved there lately. They had a dog and I asked them if the dog got used to the new home. There was a storm coming. I went outside and looked at the sky. It was overcast. It was lightning and thundering when we were in the house. We left and were standing by the curb to cross the street. A policeman was standing there with his horse. He would whisper something to his horse to make him come to him. We were filing or sawing wood at Dill's. Malley McPhail was standing and watching us at work. Then he said, ""We work tomorrow."""
"Rich People's Jackalopes  I'm driving in a carload of people who seem to be like my family. We drive on a dirt road through a wooded area with sparse houses. The houses are large, but not tall. The people who live in the houses are very rich. There are many species of animals, which I've never seen before, grazing and sitting in groups on different parts of these lawns. Among the animals, which are all mixed and interbred species, are jackalopes. We arrive at a sandy area where we'll take a ferry across some water with our vehicle. There is another vehicle there. We are divided into two groups to go on the ferry. One group is called Apollo____, and the other that I'm in is called ___ ___ ___ (I forget these names). There is then snow on the ground. Something happens with a mother and son in an old, big house."
"I was with a girlfriend, whom I can't place, on a big highway which looked like the area between the Legends Parks and the Pacific Fair; both of us were joking. Then a small car passed by and in it were two girls and two boys. I recognized one of the boys as the gym teacher in my elementary school, the other I didn't know. I saw that one of the girls was a student teacher who taught me when I was in high school, 3 or 4 years ago; I didn't know the other girl. Well, the little car went by and we hitch-hiked and they stopped. We got in and introduced ourselves. They, like us, were going to the beach. I recognized the beach we went to as Herradura, with some differences.We changed and a while later a group of boys and girls, friends of the two of us, came and we left with them. I don't' remember any more."
"I was working on a document on the computer. I was trying to pull together a lot of information into one document and add to it in a way that would accomplish what we wanted to accomplish in an easy to understand way. I was working with someone but I don't know who it was, and I have a sense that it was more than one person. I don't think the work was CAS related. I was also using highlighting in the document on the pieces of information that I was adding. The statements that I was adding including both a number and a percentage relative to what we were talking about. I had entered several and before I realized that it wasn't quite accurate or that it was misleading. I changed it and thought it was better but I still wasn't happy with it."
"Four girl friends in the dormitory and I were out on the porch roof of G____ Dormitory at night loading pamphlets into a dirigible that was hovering over the porch. They were pamphlets protesting the Communist party on campus. Mrs. C___, our house mother, looked out the window and saw us and made us come in. She reported us to the Dean and we were afraid we'd be expelled. Everybody in the school felt sorry for us and declared us martyrs to the cause. The dream ended and I don't know if we were expelled or not. Interpretation No interpretation Answers to questions 2. Excitement, anxiety3. Yes, I was an actual participant.4. Unpleasant5. No6. No."
"Last night I was having a dream that we were supposed to be together with family or something, like Sheryl, Sandra and Sam, and that we were going to go to some theme park, but somehow in all of this we were riding in the car at nighttime and it's like when we used to bring Sheryl and Sandra and Sam home from North Dakota, Jacksonville. And they were in the back and I was laying across my mother and my father's laps in the front. And the next little scene was that somehow I was all grown up and I was supposed to, I was scheming and planning a way to buy two tickets to a theme park and save it. I had won them or something. And I thought I was going to buy two tickets to Venture Island, but as it turned out, I realized that I wouldn't really want to go there because a lot of the water things that were there have these vents and jets and all the scary things in them. So I decided in this dream some strange lady gave me like a program of concerts going on at Universal Studios. And in this dream I decided that I was going to go there instead because of all the concerts and everything. And I had come up with this plan thinking that my mother and I would be able to go go by ourselves and ditch my father so we wouldn't have to listen to him complaining about everything anyway. And I was looking over this program and it said that Bett Midler and Barbara Streisand and other people were going to be there, and I was trying to make my plan. The hardest part was deciding which day to go and who to see. And then I woke up."
"One day I was on a ship and we were in a storm. We pulled the strings we were on a big ship, you know, very big, but then when we got to the other side of the ocean I got to see my friends. My friend Molly said, ""it's a great place here"" and my friend Kathy said,"" there's lots of stores here""."
"Some object that has the letters ABC on it goes underwater, back where it belongs."
I went into a building to put something back. (The man in charge of the building was the charge officer on my ward.)
"I was on my way to the CAS office to work. I needed to go to Kinko's on my way in to pick up some printing they had done for us. I was driving across 116th St. As I went through one of the intersections I saw the light turn red above me. Of course, I kept going because I was directly under the light when it turned red. As I got closer to R1 Rd., there were road crews working here and there. I think they were filling potholes. There would be two or three men at each of these different places and traffic was going pretty fast with this construction workers right there. They did not have it marked well so you would even notice them very far ahead. They weren't using orange cones or anything. Some of them were working along the side of the road to my right. Some of them were actually right in the middle of the two lanes. That was very dangerous and I was concerned for their safety, that some of them might get hurt. When I got close to where I would turn in to Kinko's there were construction workers right in the middle of the four lanes of traffic. There was also a big pile of sand right by the entrance to the parking lot. When I went to turn left into the parking lot I am now on foot. There was a lot of traffic so I ran to get across the two lanes. I think it also had been raining. I had on my white girl shoes so I was walking very gingerly so I wouldn't get my feet so wet and because I was walking through this sand. I noticed by this big pile of sand that there were also various shapes and sizes of rocks or stone. Maybe they used them to help fill potholes. I was stepping on them to avoid some of the water puddles. I was walking across the parking lot and I heard someone say something. I turned around to see if they were speaking to me and who it was. It was a woman with long blonde hair. I said, pardon me she repeated herself but I still didn't know what she said, I think I didn't understand her, but I might not have been able to hear her well. I just smiled and nodded yes, pretending that I had heard her. I kept walking. I got across the parking lot to the sidewalk where Kinko's should be but they weren't. That woman was still there so I asked her what happened to Kinko's. The space where they used to be was now a clothing store. She said something like, Well, do you just want to start here? I said, I'm sorry. I needed to go to Kinko's. What happened to them? They used to be right here. She said, Oh. No. She walked around the end of the building. At this point it almost looked as though there was a roof connecting the whole U-shaped shopping center."
"Last night I had a really embarrassing dream, and I don't know where it came from or what it's about, so I really can't be responsible for it. I dreamt that I was in this kind of semi-dark house with a tile floor, and there was a stairway like ours and there was a light on in the stairwell. But I was sitting like on a wooden chair in the middle of this living room floor, and I was babysitting this little boy. And he was like jumping up and down on the couch and stuff, and I think there was a coffee table over in front of the couch, like in our living room. And, like I said, it had a tile floor and it was kind of semi-dark, but there was light coming in the window and there was light coming from the stairwell. And this boy -- he'd come over to me and he would lean on my leg and, well, how do I say it? He would get himself hot from that. And then he would go back to jumping up and down on the couch, and I think he would do it over on the couch too. And in my dream I wasn't really concerned or embarrassed. And then his mother was there, and I was sitting on that chair on his mother's lap, and he was still running around, checking over things and jumping on the couch and coming back and doing the same thing. And that was really all there was to it, and then I woke up. That was crazy!"
"I was guiding a little girl somewhere. There was some kind of moral decision to make. Later I had to get somewhere at a certain time, and I was having trouble with the car. The wheels would get jammed some way, and there was an obstacle on the road."
"I was driving around with a friend in a Model T Ford. When we crossed an intersection, a very modern car ran into us and threw us on the side. I remember that the car was intact, and so was my friend, but I had blood on my chest. My friend then took me to a guy who lived in the suburbs. The guy was dressed in black, with an old frock and a white shirt with ruffles (a very old style). He looked very poor. He looked at my chest and said I had fractured six ribs. Then he operated on me. He cut the skin and opened the ribs at the place where they were broken (separating them with a karate chop) and he put a platinum nail on each one of them. He didn't use any anesthesia and yet I didn't feel any pain or discomfort, only a great deal of curiosity. At the end he only took a few coins and said goodbye to us (the operation had been conducted at the door of his home and the lighting came from an old kerosene lamp). My friend (M) and I went walking, but then we came back because I remembered suddenly that I had to ask him if I could breathe hard. When we returned, I realized (he had aged a great deal) that he was a beggar. This surprised me because at the beginning I thought he was a medicine man."
"A baseball game is in progress. I'm in the stands watching. A guy has a box of balls, one has a pumpkin in it that weights it so he can cheat. He's very careful to protect it so no one will know. Then he decides to nonchalantly bounce it around (looks like a small basketball), but he drops it in a pile of other balls and a boy grabs it and runs off. I say, ""It was the redhead. I'll watch for him."" Now Paul Newman is going up to bat. I stand directly behind him so close our bodies are touching and I copy all his moves. ""I'm playing baseball too,"" I say. He grins at me. Later, he's seated in the stands and I cuddle and I kiss with him. I touch his lips and say, ""Only my lipstick."" He teases me by pretending he might kiss someone else and I possessively grab him and kiss him long and sweet to keep him to me. He's aroused and we lie down. I am stroking his very hairy arm which is down by his waist so that it's almost like his penis, only furry from the amount of arm hairs. He does have a hard one and I feel good because I ""have"" him."
"I was in this drugstore (more like a small general store with a lunch counter) and I walked through to the back of the store where I played a gambling device with Joe Hill (one of my classmates). We each choose a marker (black or white) and when the machine was turned on the markers would travel through a maze at the end of the maze was a straight stretch into a cup and the first marker into the cup won. The machine randomly changed the coefficient of friction of the markers so that one would slide faster than the others. The marker I chose was fastest through the maze, but lost right at the very end. Then the scene changed and I was with a mixed group of boys and girls. They were pairing off (boy with girl) and soon I was standing alone with Phyllis (a girl in my class) in a room which had four rooms opening into it (one from each side) and where each couple occupied one room. I looked around and Phyllis was the only one left and the one I least desired to sleep with. She was lying down on a bed with her arms outstretched to me. I took off my clothes and with a mental shrug of indifference lay down beside her. She embraced me and her body was warm and soft -- more pleasing than I had anticipated. Then I woke up."
"(07/21/64) I was in some sort of orchestral-vocal production, and we were rehearsing. All the voice parts were going to have to sing separately so the director could hear them and criticize. We first sang some song which isn't actually Green Grow the Rushes, but which had the same tune and refrain, ""one is one...."" But in the dream I didn't know the song and sort of goofed when I sang it alone. But I was proud of myself for singing in front of all those people anyway. Then Karen Lucas sang, and instead of singing the song we were supposed to, she sang some esoteric folksong which made the director very happy. Another girl sang and then it was time to go, and I sang a song I knew loudly so he would hear and know that I could sing if it was a song I knew. On the way home I was walking with someone, very like my husband. It was in the city, I was unmarried, and had a sort of deformity, a twisted leg or something (the one that's been hurting me since camping). but he had his arm around me. Another girl came up, a sort of loose type, and started flirting with him. He was very nice to her. She asked him to a party as if I wasn't there. He said he would come if he could bring me. She made some very insulting remark about me, but he said she was wrong to say things like that and that we both would be coming to her party. I didn't want to go after being insulted like that, but I was happy he wanted to be with me."
