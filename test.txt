[ERIKA]
If I'd like to have my breakfast hot
Madame Carp will make me pay
And I have to fetch the eggs myself
And the barn's a mile away
It's cold and wet, yet still I get
An omelette on my plate
But in my head I'm back in bed
Snuggled up and sleeping late

[ANNELIESE, spoken]
Really?

[ERIKA, spoken]
Really. But it's all right. I mean, I'm used to it. And you?

[ANNELIESE, spoken]
Well...

[ERIKA, spoken]
Well?

[ANNELIESE]
If I want some eggs I ring the bell
And the maid comes running in
And she serves them on a silver tray
And she brings a cookie tin
And while I eat, she rubs my feet
And strolling minstrels play
But I'd rather be in my library
Reading science books all day
See pop shows near Berlin
Get tickets as low as $36

I'm just like you

[ANNELIESE, spoken]
You are?

[ERIKA]
You're just like me
There's somewhere else we'd rather be
Somewhere that's ours
Somewhere that dreams come true
Yes, I am a girl like you
You'd never think
That it was so
But now I've met you and I know
It's plain as day
Sure as the sky is blue
That I am a girl like you

[ANNELIESE, spoken]
So, you're a singer?

[ERIKA, spoken]
No, I work at Madame Carp's penitentiary. Uh, I mean Dress Emporium

[ANNELIESE, spoken]
I love Madame Carp's dresses!
[ERIKA, spoken]
I made the one you're wearing

[ANNELIESE, spoken]
You made this? It's my favorite. The design looks so complicated!

[ERIKA, spoken]
Oh, but it isn't really

[ANNELIESE, ERIKA, ANNELIESE & ERIKA]
First I choose a fabric from the rack
And I pin the pattern down
And I stitch it in the front and back
And it turns into a gown!
I wear the gown without my crown
And dance around my room
And imagine life without the strife
Of an unfamiliar groom

[ANNELIESE, spoken]
But I'd never let my mother know. I wouldn't want to disappoint her

[ERIKA, spoken]
I completely understand

[ANNELIESE, ERIKA, ANNELIESE & ERIKA]
I'm just like you
I think that's true
You're just like me
Yes, I can see
We take responsibility
We carry through
We carry through
Do what we need to do
Yes, I am a girl like you
I'm just like you
I'm just like you
You're just like me
You're just like me
It's something anyone can see
A heart that beats
A heart that beats
A voice that speaks the truth
Yes, I am a girl like you
