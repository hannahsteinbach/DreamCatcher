## **The DreamCatcher: A Digital Dream Journal Powered by a Large Language Model**

We present the _DreamCatcher_, a digital dream journal powered by a large language model. Llama3 is used to process users' dreams, facilitating the tracking of dreams, by automatically extracting characters, locations, keywords, and emotions. Users can log and access their dreams, as well as make queries and sort them according to these automated features and additional criteria, such as dream types and strings. This functionality is enabled through buttons, menus, and search bars in the Dream Journal and the Dream Gallery. The Dream Gallery serves as a social network that encourages users to share their dreams, and like and comment on other users dreams. Even more features include similarity search, having complementary questionnaires to potentially find interrelationships between their dreaming and sleeping life, and their waking life, as well as statistics and monthly recaps to maintain an constant overview of one's dreams, experiences, and feelings. 


## All you have to do is: 

go into repository: 
```cd ./django/dreamcatcher```

run the following command: 
```python manage.py runserver```
